Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), was a German philosopher and writer who greatly influenced Western philosophy and modern intellectual history. He was a strong advocate of Social Darwinism, and his views contributed to nihilism. This new philosophy taught that life is empty, meaningless, and ultimately ends in death. And as you can imagine, nihilism led many to inner withdrawal, despair, frustration, violence, depression, and/or suicide.

Today, nihilism is a prevalent philosophy, even if you have never heard the word. It's common for young people to go through phases of depression, and common to hear about them committing suicide. Many of us don't even bat an eyelash when we hear about the rising rates, unless, of course, someone we know and care for is either depressed or suicidal. Lack of purpose in our lives, and the lives of our children, is not something we should encourage or ignore, it's a *real* problem. Nietzsche's ideas, which were based on Social Darwinism, encouraged and taught us that everything we will ever do our entire lives are truly meaningless, and that life itself is hopeless. Nothing matters, not even ourselves. It's no surprise that suicide rates are rising, depression is normal, and right and wrong don't matter. After all, isn't that what we are teaching the new generations? If life is meaningless, I might as well do whatever I want, when I want, and if I can't, there's no reason to stick around.

Nietzsche has been dead for over a century, yet his views and ideas continue to plague us today. It's about time that we stop this philosophy from taking root in our society and filling our lives with lies and emptiness. Nihilism needs to be replaced with a different philosophy, one that teaches that we all have a purpose to fulfill and there is One who loves us no matter what. It is time for the truth to replace the darkness.

Rise up warriors and send nihilism back where it belongs. Rise up and replace death with life, despair with hope, violence with peace, and depression with meaning.
