Aric Shadowbane was once a noble knight from the Kingdom of Eldoria, a realm known for its lush forests and ancient magic. As the youngest son of the noble House Shadowbane, Aric grew up in the shadow of his elder siblings, never expected to inherit lands or titles. Instead, he found solace in the deep, mysterious woods surrounding his family's estate, where he honed his skills in stealth and swordsmanship.

During a fierce war with a neighboring kingdom, Aric's entire family was betrayed by one of their closest allies. The Shadowbane estate was razed, and Aric's kin were slaughtered. Aric barely escaped with his life, fleeing deep into the Blackwood, a cursed forest that no one dared to enter. It was said that those who entered the Blackwood either never returned or emerged changed, their souls tainted by the dark magic that lurked within.

Aric, consumed by grief and rage, wandered the Blackwood for days until he stumbled upon an ancient, forgotten shrine. Here, he made a pact with the forest’s dark spirits, trading his soul for the power to avenge his family. The spirits granted him a steed, a massive black warhorse with eyes like embers, and clad him in armor that shrouded his identity, his face forever hidden beneath a dark hood.

Now known as the Veiled Rider, Aric haunts the Blackwood, emerging only to hunt down those responsible for his family's downfall. He is both feared and revered, a spectral figure who strikes terror into the hearts of those who travel too close to his domain. Rumors say that he cannot be killed, for the dark spirits have bound his life force to the forest itself. Some believe that he seeks not only vengeance but also redemption, hoping that by eradicating the traitors, he can finally free himself from the curse that binds him to the Blackwood.

Aric's legend has grown over the years, and now, travelers speak of a shadowy figure who rides through the mist-shrouded woods, his eyes glowing like embers in the night. They say that if you hear the pounding of hooves behind you in the Blackwood, it's already too late—for the Veiled Rider is upon you, and he will not rest until his blood oath is fulfilled.
