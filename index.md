Welcome to my digital garden! What's that? Well, a digital garden is a curated set of notes, and it’s often shared online for learning and sharing purposes. My garden is mostly full of my [study notes](/garden/study-notes/){: .wiki-link} or plain ole' [random notes](/garden/notes/){: .wiki-link}, as well as whatever type of [prose](/garden/prose/){: .wiki-link} or [world](/garden/worldbuilding/){: .wiki-link} I’m working on at the moment. So, yes, I’m tending to it nearly every day.

With that out of the way, just a fair warning, not everything in this garden will make sense to you. There are some sections that are… shall we say, little buds that need a bit more watering and time before they're big enough to actually portray their species. To help you (and me) figure out the growth status of a page, there are emojis on every one that show their current state within the garden.

| Emoji | Name     | Description                                                                           |
| ----- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🌱     | Seedling | A new idea that is slowly emerging and waiting to be cultivated.                      |
| 🌿     | Branch   | Connected to other seedlings, and possibly blooms.                                    |
| 🌸     | Bloom    | Beautiful, but not permanent, needs some cross-pollination.                           |
| 🌲     | Tree     | Mature, sturdy, a strong parent of many other little seedlings, branches, and blooms. |

Any-who, catch you later!

(P.S. no, I’m not British or a crazy scientist, I’m just a writer who likes to have fun and make people smile. So, yeah, sometimes I talk and act silly just because 😁)
