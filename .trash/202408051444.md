> Chapter 1 outlines 6 different major ethical views. Chapter 8 outlines 11+ different views about the basis for what is morally right. Do you know the difference? In other words, what makes the outline of the 6 major ethical views different from the 11+ different views about the basis for what is morally right? Why are there two perceptibly different lists? How do you reconcile these two lists? Are the 11+ views in Chapter 8 embedded underneath (or included in) the 6 major views from Chapter 1? If so, which ones go where? Answer this essay in 1-3 pages (maybe 1-2 pages if there are no diagrams, tables, flowcharts, etc...). Do not make this a major paper. It can include a flowchart, diagram, or table if necessary. Basically, I am looking for and wanting to know if you can explain the relevance of Chapter 8 with what was presented in Chapter 1 in a semi-simple summary. If you can do this in 1 page, then great! This does not have to be in strict essay form, but can include bullet lists. In other words, just try to answer the question as simply as possible without embellishment or worrying about word-count. This kind of paper requires a bit more thinking and planning, and actually less writing. This is open-ended. Run with it and go with the spirit of the question. You have a good measure of flexibility.
