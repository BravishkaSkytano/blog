## How Does God Speak Through Him?

Honestly, Iâ€™ve had a lot of trouble finding one word to describe Kieron, none of them seem to strongly convey my view of him. My first thought is that heâ€™s dependable. Iâ€™ve never been able to depend on someone to be there for me, to support me, besides God. And then thereâ€™s the way he always finds a way to help me chill out. Even talking to him is refreshing because I can say anything, and he just takes it. When I yell, he tells me to calm down and stop raising my voice at him. And, sometimes when I curse, he tells me to be better than that. I never get offended either. Thereâ€™s never a moment when I feel like I need to hide or pretend to be someone else; I can always just be myself without fear that heâ€™s going to manipulate me. I guess thatâ€™s my favorite thing about him, I can be free with him.

Itâ€™s all still a jumble in my head, and I still feel like Iâ€™m missing something; but thatâ€™s a start.
