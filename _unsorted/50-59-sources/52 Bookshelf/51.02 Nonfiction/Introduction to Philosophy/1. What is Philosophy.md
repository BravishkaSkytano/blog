> ...a course in philosophy is not an attempt to teach some unusual set of facts or to provide a totally new skill. It is, rather, an effort to help the student improve an ability that he already possesses and at times exercises on his own.[@geislerIntroductionPhilosophyChristian1980, p. 9]

- _philo_ (love) + _sophy_ (wisdom) = _philosophy_ (loving wisdom)
- the ancients, like the Greeks, were primarily concerned with finding happiness through knowledge and wisdom.
- philosophers disagree among themselves as to the definition of philosophy
- began around 600 B.C. in Miletus, a Greek colony

## Analytic philosophy or conceptual analysis

- **main purpose of philosophy is the analytic study of concepts**
- **the “why” behind our beliefs and actions**
- popular enough to be recognized as a school of philosophy in the twentieth century
- Objections
    - questions about meaning are glorified while questions about truth are pushed under the table
    - the key concept of the verification principle is unreliable
        - the meaningfulness of propositions are NOT determined by 1+ of the five senses, or it’s definitional state

> We can spend so much time defining the terms in a statement that we lose sight of the truth of the statement.[@geislerIntroductionPhilosophyChristian1980, p. 13]

## Speculative philosophy

- **“how” it should be; how we should act**
- comes after analytic philosophy; knowledge of the concepts is required before one can determine how they should work
- Objections
    - it’s impossible to combine all knowledge and values
    - it’s nonsense and pointless

> Philosophy is, then, the critical analysis of fundamental concepts of human inquiry, and the normative discussion of how human thought and action ought to function, as well as the description of the nature of reality.[@geislerIntroductionPhilosophyChristian1980, p. 15]

## Philosophical inquiry

- doesn’t necessarily center around facts
- discussions are caused by disagreements of interpretation, e.g. which is best or “worth it”
- the answer is usually not whatever is factual
- strengthens skills, not your knowledge bank
- focuses on applying critical thinking skills to arguments, presuppositions, and truth claims
- search for truth about life’s most important questions
- answers must align with the system of principles surrounding the subject being discussed
- **deals with _how_ we know (epistemology) and _what_ we know about reality (metaphysics).**

## Why study philosophy?

- it helps you understand your society
- prevents prejudice, provincialism, and poor reasoning
- it is necessary for the development of a strong and mature faith

> Since all truth is God’s truth, and since philosophy is a quest for truth, then philosophy will contribute to our understanding of God and His world.[@geislerIntroductionPhilosophyChristian1980, p. 20]
