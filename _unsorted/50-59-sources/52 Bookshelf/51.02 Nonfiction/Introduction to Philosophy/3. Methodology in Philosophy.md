## Some Methods from the Ancient World

### Socrates’ Method: Interrogation

- arguably the most famous method in the ancient world
- also known as the question-and-answer method
- gets the individual to remember the truths ingrained in his soul
- mostly rejected today due to the belief that our minds start as blank slates ready to be written with XP

### Zeno’s Method: Reductio ad Absurdum

- Zeno was the famous pupil of Parmenides
- developed before Socrates
- ultimate reality is one, not many
- pros
    - led to the fundamental law of noncontradiction—a position can’t be true if it has contradictions
- cons
    - can be used with highly questionable premises
    - not all arguments can be equally divided into 2 alternatives
    - it’s often hard to find a contradiction with divided arguments
- negative test for truth; can make things appear false, but can’t make them appear true

### Aristotle’s Method: Deduction

- Aristotle used both inductive and deductive reasoning, but he’s more famous for deduction
- _deductive reasoning:_ general → particular
    - e.g. if all horses are 4-legged animals, and Black Beauty is a horse, then Black Beauty must be a 4-legged animal
- _inductive reasoning:_ particular → general
    - e.g. all observable elements of a wall are stone, therefore, the whole wall is stone
- can be problematic due to disagreement regarding universal trues
- they can accommodate uncertainties (e.g. it is _probably_ true that all men are mortal)
