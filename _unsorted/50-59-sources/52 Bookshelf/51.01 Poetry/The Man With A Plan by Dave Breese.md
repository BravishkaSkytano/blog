> The pavilion of the nations was an awesome place that day
> With the throb of martial music ֈneath a fiery display,
> With the flags of all the nations lifted upward to the stars,
> With kings and queens and princes stepping from their stately cars.
> 
> The peoples of the planet were represented there,
> For the world had been invited to come and think and share.
> In the midst of global crises of a hundred separate kinds,
> They came for new solutions, for a meeting of the minds.
> 
> “We must have all new answers,” said the leaders of the day.
> “We come from starving people, bankrupt countries, disarray.
> Ugly wars are raging ’round us, rivers flood, and cities burn,
> Murder, arson, rape and pillage—death awaits at every turn,”
> 
> “We sense,” they said, “that we will have been in every way betrayed.
> Our dreams are now in ruins and our people are dismayed.
> Our hope, once placed in state, in church, in God, in love, in race
> is gone, along with faith itself. What now shall take its place?”
> 
> Then a man stepped to the platform, to the circle of the light,
> Who with words of warmest greeting said, “We welcome you tonight.
> You have come from every nation of this sad and troubled earth
> To seek a fresh beginning, yes, a new and nobler birth.”
> “I can tell you,” said the speaker, “in this time of hate and fear,
> Though problems seem unsolvable, frustrations’s end is near.
> The turning point of history could be this very day,
> For there is one who shall soon come to sweep your fears away.”
> 
> With these and many other words he promised all things new
> To all the peoples of the world, the Gentile and the Jew,
> To red and yellow, black and white, the miracle would come.
> The new and golden age would dawn, the old must now succumb.
> 
> He spoke of possibilities, of challenges, of goals.
> How man, believing in himself, the universe controls.
> ”You are the gods of this New Age,” he said to that great throng,
> Which then, transported by his words, broke forth in gladsome song.
> 
> A thunderous ovation roared from that adoring crowd.
> With cheers of acclamation both loud and still more loud.
> Ah, how the crowd exulted, holding high each little son
> To see him who would tell them of the world that can be won.
> 
> Bathed in that light and clothed in white he welcomed their applause.
> Then he, impassioned, spoke of things beyond all human laws.
> How shifting in the paradigm was making all things new.
> The awe-struck crowd saw in his words the beautiful, the true.
> The throng was hushed, “How could,” they thought, “we live to hear this voice
> Which calls us to this bright design and offers us the choice?
> We can now step up to greatness, affirm the spacious plan,
> Give ourselves in privileged service to this dear and cosmic man.”
> 
> Then he, as if divining that crowd’s emergent mind,
> How they would make of him the man to guide the new mankind
> Then escalate him to a throne, with scepter, crown, and ring
> Where he in wisdom, power and love would rule everything.
> 
> He said, “Now you must listen and hear me in this hour.
> There is one much moer endowed than I with wisdom, force and power.
> He is himself the one who forged this wide, colossal plan.
> He is himself the greatest mind yet given to mortal man.”
> 
> “He has the power to move the world to set the nations free,
> To bring upon our suffering earth its long-sought liberty,
> To be the final stanza of the anthem mankind sings.
> And—Ah, the joy!—he even now is waiting in the wings!”
> 
> With this the crowd was plunged into silence, stunned and still,
> “What could this mean—A man who now would all our hopes fulfill?”
> “Yes!” said the white-clothed figure as he gestured toward the gate,
> Where an entourage moved slowly as if neither soon nor late.
> 
> Each eye transfigured upon that group then focused on a man,
> Who by his sheer demeanor seemed all social gulfs to span.
> “He truly is majestic,” thought the throng which stood and stared
> As he rode astride a charger white, whose crimson nostrils flared.
> 
> He ascended to the dias, more widely to be seen,
> Then stood before that trembling throng with strong and stately mein.
> His impact on that multitude was wondrous to behold.
> They then stood still as gifted words upon them he bestowed
> 
> “My dear and noble comrades, co-citizens of fate,
> This day begins upon this earth an era new and great.
> For now the gods have chosen that this must be the time
> When all that is is newly made—when all shall be sublime.”
> 
> “We gather here from myriad scenes, from every hemisphere,
> Our homes, our farms, our children are the reason we are here.
> We seek the unity of earth where faction is no more.
> The ship of state must anchor on a new and peaceful shore.”
> 
> “When men of earth must join as one, yes e’en the stars o’er head,
> The masters of the universe, together they have said,
> The ages past and those to come conjoin this very day
> To now transport us to the realm where gods alone hold sway.’”
> 
> “My promise is eternal peace, the gods of war deposed,
> We’ll see the age of verdance green, the fig tree and the rose.
> Earth will become a garden fair which blooms from sea to sea.
> The parliament of nations ordains these things to be.”
> 
> The man (But was this just a man?) spoke on that fateful eve,
> His flashing eyes, his golden voice, his words without reprieve
> Moved from his mighty master-mind to every waiting ear
> To capture for the glorious cause each soul, both far and near.
> 
> But wait—the speaker lifts his hands, a roar sounds loud and high,
> Then—Could it be?—cascading fire falls from the flaming sky.
> The raging conflagration for a moment sweeps the tier
> Before the lighted faces now aghast with living fear.
> 
> It swept upon that orator, before that wide-eyed crowd,
> He still stepped out majestically unhurried and uncowed.
> “The fire,” he said, “has in myself now cleansed the souls of men.
> The limits on humanity shall never be again.”
> 
> From that moment of all moments one could never be the same.
> The nations of the world became the clients of his fame.
> The rulers and the ruled of earth, with tears of ecstasy,
> Enrolled to join the legions of that man of destiny.
> 
> The next vortex of history was forged on earth that hour.
> A cryptic new compulsion would seize men with its power.
> Certain now of greatness, they would stand in glory’s ray.
> The pavilion of the nations was an awesome place that day.
