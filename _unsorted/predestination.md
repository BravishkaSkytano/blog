# Predestination

#ðŸ¥€

> **Predestination**, in theology, is the doctrine that all events have been willed by God, usually with reference to the eventual fate of the individual soul. Explanations of predestination often seek to address the paradox of free will, whereby God's omniscience seems incompatible with human free will. In this usage, predestination can be regarded as a form of religious determinism; and usually predeterminism, also known as theological determinism.

## Q: Are we predestined to destruction?

> [!bible] [[Romans 8#29|Romans 8:29-]][[Romans 8#30|30]]
> <sup>**29** </sup>For those God foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brothers. <sup>**30** </sup>And those He predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified. 

> [!bible] [[Ephesians 1#5|Ephesians 1:5]]
> <sup>**5** </sup>He predestined us for adoption as His sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His will, 

> [!bible] [[1 Peter 1#2|1 Peter 1:2]]
> <sup>**2** </sup>according to the foreknowledge of God the Father and sanctified by the Spirit for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by His blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance. 

> [!bible] [[Acts 2#23|Acts 2:23]]
> <sup>**23** </sup>He was delivered up by Godâ€™s set plan and foreknowledge, and you, by the hands of the lawless, put Him to death by nailing Him to the cross.

## A: No, God created us all equally, and He wanted us all to be in heaven with Him. If we are all predestined, then we donâ€™t have free choice.

> [!bible] [[2 Peter 3#9|2 Peter 3:9]]

> [!bible] [[2 Timothy 1#9|2 Timothy 1:9]]
> <sup>**9** </sup>He has saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works, but by His own purpose and by the grace He granted us in Christ Jesus before time began.
