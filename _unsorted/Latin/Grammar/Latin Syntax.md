> NOTA BENE: In a Latin sentence the most important word is the *first word;* next in importance is the *last word;* the weakest point is the middle of the sentence. Usually the *subject* is the most important word and is placed *first;* then the *verb* (in the future we will call the predicate the verb.) is placed *last.* The other words of the sentence stand between these two in the order of their importance. However, word order is **just a style and not necessarily one way** or another. That is why the endings are important to identify the different parts of the sentence.

**Subject - Modifiers of the Subject - Indirect Object - Direct Object - Adverb - Verb**

The Romans loved the periodic style--the intent of putting the verb at the end is to keep the reader or hearer in suspense--but often changed the order for variety or emphasis.
