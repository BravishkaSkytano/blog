> **Free Grace Theology** is a [[202401291553|Christian]] soteriological view which holds that the only condition of salvation is faith, excluding good works and perseverance, holding to eternal security. Free Grace advocates believe that good works are not the condition to merit (as with Catholics), to maintain (as with Arminians), or to prove (as with most Calvinists) salvation, but rather are part of discipleship and the basis for receiving eternal rewards. This soteriological view distinguishes between salvation and discipleship â€“ the call to believe in Christ as Savior and to receive the gift of eternal life, and the call to follow Christ and become an obedient disciple, respectively.Free grace theology emphasizes the possibility of full assurance and the freeness of salvation.
