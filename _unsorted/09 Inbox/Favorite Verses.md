> <sup>**10** </sup>All who rely on works of the law are under a curse. For it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.” <sup>**11** </sup>Now it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because, “The righteous will live by faith.” <sup>**12** </sup>The law, however, is not based on faith; on the contrary, “The man who does these things will live by them.” <sup>**13** </sup>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. For it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.” <sup>**14** </sup>He redeemed us in order that the blessing promised to Abraham would come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.

> <sup>**17** </sup>What I mean is this: The law that came 430 years later does not revoke the covenant previously established by God, so as to nullify the promise. <sup>**18** </sup>For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on a promise; but God freely granted it to Abraham through a promise. <sup>**19** </sup>Why then was the law given? It was added because of transgressions, until the arrival of the seed to whom the promise referred. It was administered through angels by a mediator. [[Galatians 3#18|]]

> <sup>**1** </sup>Brothers, if someone is caught in a trespass, you who are spiritual should restore him with a spirit of gentleness. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.
