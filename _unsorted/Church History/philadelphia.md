# Philadelphia, the Faithful Church

Philadelphia was founded by King Attalus II of [[Pergamum]] in 150 B.C. and became known as the “[[Gateway to the East]].” Its trademark consisted of grapes, textiles, and leather goods. And during the [[Byzantine]] times, it became an important center of [[Christianity]].

It was the second of the two churches that received no condemnation from [[Jesus]], instead Jesus spoke about the people of the local church and its potential, principles, and priorities. Like [[Smyrna]], the Jewish community in Philadelphia was very hostile to Christians, yet the Christians remained faithful even with their weaknesses. Jesus opened doors for them and promised that one day their enemies would see the truth and praise His followers. Jesus condemned all of Philadelphia’s persecutors and promised to protect the church from the “hour of trial.” The followers of Christ are the pillars of God’s temple and carry the names of God, His city [[Jerusalem]], and Jesus.
