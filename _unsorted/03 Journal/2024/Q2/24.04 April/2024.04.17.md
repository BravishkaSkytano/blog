### Memos

- Today at [[The Virtues Campus|Virtues]], we studied the theology of [[55.58 Hebrews|Hebrews]]
- [[BIO102 Natural Science and Biology]] - [[The Biblical Basis for Modern Science - Henry Morris]] - Chapter 5: Creation of the World
	- ‚ÄúCosmogony is the study of ideas about the origin of the cosmos.‚Äù Not to be confused with cosmology, the study of the cosmos in all its aspects.
	- The Bible contains the only real creationist cosmogony, all other systems start with an existing universe.
	- Scientists can‚Äôt act out the creation of the universe because we were not there; consequently, the only way we can know how the universe was created is through divine revelation. And, divine revelation can only be given out by a personal, omnipotent God who exists outside time and space.
	- According to the second law of [[thermodynamics]], time had to have a beginning because the universe will ‚Äúdie‚Äù at some point.
