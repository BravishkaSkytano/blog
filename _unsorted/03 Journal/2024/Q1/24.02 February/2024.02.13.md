SMH, I've been watching a K-Drama all day because Mom decided to put one on while I was sleeping and I woke up to screaming lol. It's called Missing 9 and it's about a group of celebrities who get stranded on a deserted island after their company's private jet crashed. It's definately entertaining, but it's annoying that the story is being revealed little by little and there's so many plot twists :'(
