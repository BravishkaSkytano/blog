Today was okay. We had the March for Life rally again. Of course, we got there late and the whole thing was finished. It was snowing and a little breezy, so we were also cold. Got some nice pics though. We also built Mom's first snowman. She didn't help us assemble it ðŸ˜† she just wanted the experience of making a big snowball. We didn't make it to the expo either, the thirty-minute walk was a waste. Now, my body hurts and I have a headache. I need food and water, two things we haven't had much of today.

- Converting Decimals to Fractions (3-6) #homework
	- Rewrite the decimals as a fraction using the smallest place value and reduce to the lowest terms
		- 0.045 = 45/1000 = 9/200
		- 1.5 = 1 5/10 = 1 1/2
	- You Try
		- 0.875 = 875/1000 / 25 = 35/40 / 5 = 7/8
		- 23.076 = 23 76/1000 / 4 = 19/250
		- 0.004 = 4/1000 / 4 = 1/250
- Converting Fractions to Decimals (3-7)
	- Divide the numerator by the denominator
		- 8/25 = 0.32
		- 3 1/2 = 7/2 = 3.5
	- You Try
		- 4/5 = 0.80
		- 84 2/3 = 254/3 = 84.67
