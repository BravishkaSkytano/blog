### Journal

- First time trying Logseq. I like that it uses outlines and I can't get distracted trying to customize things. Oh, and it's FOSS, of course.
- So there is *some* customization, but not a lot. Everything is pretty simple.
- At some point, I need to figure out how to export pages. I might have to use Pandoc on my client instead of through the app.
