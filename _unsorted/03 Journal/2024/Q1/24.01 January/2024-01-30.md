Woke up, did my devotion. It was on [[Mark 13#33]] on how we need to take care of the possessions God has given us until Jesus returns.

I just got back from Dunkin, their Wake Up Pancake is so small lol. Anyway, I walked there and it took me about 12 minutes there and another 12 back. The walk back felt quicker though for some reason. Now, I'm ready to play RuneScape :D

#### 10:00

Bruh, I can't play RuneScape through Steam on Linux???? Okay.... RuneScape has an official Linux installer though so I guess I just have to install it that way.

#### 11:31

Instead of playing RuneScape, I watched The Vampire Diaries. This whole Katherine thing is getting annoying.
