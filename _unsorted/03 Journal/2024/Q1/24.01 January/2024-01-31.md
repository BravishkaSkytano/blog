### Journal

#### 09:18

The Trinity is not like an egg because the parts of an egg can be separated. A better analogy is a triangle.

#### 09:19

Do these verses prove that Jesus is God the Father as [[Oneness Pentecostal]] believe?

> 1 Corinthians 1:3
> ![[1 Cor 1#3]]

> Romans 1:7
> ![[Rom 1#7]]

They argue that "and" (Greek: kai) in the phrase should be translated as even, making Jesus and the Father seem like one. It is true that *kai* can be translated as "even" but *kai* has a very limited semantic range.

#### 09:28

Is water baptism a condition for salvation?

> 1 Corinthians 1:17
> ![[ 1 Cor 1#17]]

> Matthew 28:19
> ![[Matt 28#19]]

Paul says Christ didn't send him to baptize people, yet Christ commission his disciples to baptize people. Therefore, is baptism required for salvation? Some groups, such as the [[Mormons]], think so.

 Paul wasn't opposed to baptism ([[Acts 2#38]]), but he didn't believe it was a requirement for salvation. He believed it was a symbol of salvation.

#### 09:36

> 1 Corinthians 3:15
> ![[1 Cor 3#15]]

Paul declares that people are saved only through fire. [[Roman Catholic]] scholars argue that "the Latin Fathers take the passage to mean a transient purification punishment in the other world." (Ott, 1960, 483)

Here, Paul is speaking about *works,* not people. He is saying that we will have a "reward" in heaven.

#### 09:40

Was Paul's condemnation of homosexuality merely his own idea? Was he against all homosexual acts, or only offensive ones?

> 1 Corinthians 6:9
> ![[1 Cor 6#9]]
