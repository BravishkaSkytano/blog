Earlier, I installed Garuda Linux on my MSI laptop and it looks beautiful. It will probably take a little while to get interested to the package manager (ugh, Pacman) and the way things work. But hey, Linux is fun and this is something I've wanted to try out for a while.

FYI: Rhino Linux lagged a few times on startup and shutdown. I actually had to force a shutdown three times.

Oh, and I just installed Steam! I can't wait to try it out! Shall we do Runescape or SWTOR first?????
