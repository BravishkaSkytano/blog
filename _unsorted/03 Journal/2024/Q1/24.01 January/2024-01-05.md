### Journal

- **[00:08]**  I need to start reading [[The Screwtape Letters]]
- **[17:40]**  I think I need to learn Datalog, it seems interesting
- **[22:07]**  today has seemed slow. I woke up late, again, but I had a nice long shower and I never felt rushed. Well, I am kinda rushing to finished reading the required materials so I can take the UTF test and submit the math stuff for CCU. However, I still feel like the day was a bit slow. I guess I'm bored, I don't know.
