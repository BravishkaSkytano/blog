### Journal

#### 08:22

We're at CCOB for Sidewalk Advocacy Training, and this is going to take a while.

#### 16:29

The training was okay, but it took so long. We're on our way back to NY and I really need to finish these school assignments.

Also, I need to be more consistant in my journal entries because there are some stuff I don't want to forget, like the day I got my first gaming laptop! Mom really surprised me with that, I never would've guessed that she would just buy a laptop for $350 without planning just because it was on clearance. Still wow.


#### 19:25

I want to start on BSB importation today. Hopefully, I can get somewhere while I listen to my math videos.

#### 21:51

Number for [[GallopNYC]] is (646)-762-7999
