## Memos

- HeartDive - Isaiah 54-58
	- [[Isaiah 54#14|Isaiah 54:14]] - with
	- [[Isaiah 55#1|Isaiah 55:1-]][[Isaiah 55#2|2]] - What are you spending your money on? Is it really valuable?
	- [[Isaiah 55#8|Isaiah 55:8-]][[Isaiah 55#9|9]] - Are you trying to fit God into your mold or your plans? Or are you abiding by His mold and His plans?
	- [[Isaiah 56#3|Isaiah 56:3-]][[Isaiah 56#5|5]][[Isaiah 56#4|]] - God sees the outcasts and, if they keep His commandments, He will honor and reward them.
	- [[Isaiah 56#6|Isaiah 56:6-]][[Isaiah 56#7|7]] - God also offers His covenant of forgiveness to all, not just to the Israelites and Jews. Do you also have a heart for the outcasts?
	- [[Isaiah 57#1|Isaiah 57:1]] - Might be a reference to the rapture.
	- [[Isaiah 58#5|Isaiah 58:5-]][[Isaiah 58#7|7]][[Isaiah 58#6|]] - Fasting is meant to be an act that brings us closer to God, not some ritual to make us look good. It is a time to focus on the needs of others over your own.
	- [[Isaiah 58#9|Isaiah 58:9-]][[Isaiah 58#14|14]][[Isaiah 58#10|]][[Isaiah 58#11|]][[Isaiah 58#12|]][[Isaiah 58#13|]] - another promise of blessing from the Lord for if we turn from our wickedness and focus on Him and His Word.
