## Memos

>[!bible] [[Matthew 11#28|Matthew 11:28]]
<sup>**28** </sup> Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 

- **“Come to Me…”**—an action that requires you to leave somewhere to go somewhere else.
	- It can be physical—all the disciples left something behind to follow Jesus.
	- Or spiritual—leave your sinful lives and whatever traditions you have and follow Jesus.
	- Jesus didn’t say come to church or to a cathedral, He said “come to *Me*.”
- **“… All of you…”**—it doesn’t matter what sex, race, country, class, or history you have, Jesus wants you.
- **“… who are weary…”**—participating in this rat race called life and make us so exhausted and fed up with everything.
- **“…and burdened…”**—we are all carrying weights that make life even more difficult and complicated.
	- examples of burdens include death, finances, and secret lives.
- **“… and I will give you rest.”**—aka tranquility, peace, silence, freedom, etc. Now take those words and add “indescribable” and “perfect.” That’s the kind of “rest” Jesus is speaking of.
