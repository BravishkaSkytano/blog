>[!bible] [[Mark 2#1|Mark 2:1-]][[Mark 2#12|12]]
<sup>**1** </sup> A few days later Jesus went back to Capernaum. And when the people heard that He was home, <sup>**2** </sup> they gathered in such large numbers that there was no more room, not even outside the door, as Jesus spoke the word to them. <sup>**3** </sup> Then a paralytic was brought to Him, carried by four men. <sup>**4** </sup> Since they were unable to get to Jesus through the crowd, they uncovered the roof above Him, made an opening, and lowered the paralytic on his mat. <sup>**5** </sup> When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.” <sup>**6** </sup> But some of the scribes were sitting there and thinking in their hearts, <sup>**7** </sup> “Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” <sup>**8** </sup> At once Jesus knew in His spirit that they were thinking this way within themselves. “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?” He asked. <sup>**9** </sup> “Which is easier: to say to a paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your mat, and walk’? <sup>**10** </sup> But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...” He said to the paralytic, <sup>**11** </sup> “I tell you, get up, pick up your mat, and go home.” <sup>**12** </sup> And immediately the man got up, picked up his mat, and walked out in front of them all. As a result, they were all astounded and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!” [[Mark 2#2|]][[Mark 2#3|]][[Mark 2#4|]][[Mark 2#5|]][[Mark 2#6|]][[Mark 2#7|]][[Mark 2#8|]][[Mark 2#9|]][[Mark 2#10|]][[Mark 2#11|]]

As little children, our perception of what we “need” is often wrong. Kids don’t want to bathe or study, and candy and desert should always be on the menu. However, as adults and parents, we know that even though they don’t want to bathe or study, both of those activities are needed. Even though candy and desert taste great, we know that it isn’t good to eat those things all the time. Isn’t the same true with us and God? He knows what we really need and will come up with a thousand ways to say “no” or guide us to doing the things we don’t want to do because we need to do them.

Jesus knows us better than we know ourselves, and that’s why He knows what we really need and when we need it.
