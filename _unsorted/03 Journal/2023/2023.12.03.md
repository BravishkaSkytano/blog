Paul wrote that the secret to his strength was God.

He was flogged 39 times like Jesus and yet Paul still traveled and shared the Gospel.

>  <sup> **16** </sup>Therefore we donâ€™t faint, but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day. <sup> **17** </sup>For our light affliction, which is for the moment, works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory; <sup> **18** </sup>while we donâ€™t look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
 %% #2 Corinthians %%

Every day, our spirits are to be renewed. We have to pay attention to our spirit, that is the secret to being strong in the Lord. Once we activate our spirit by spending time in the Bible and meditating, we will discover the strength that Paul had each day. Every day, we must take at least 5 minutes to *listen* to the Lord, before we talk about all our own wants and problems. When we actually have a *conversation,* 2+ people speaking, with God, we wonâ€™t need any antidepressants or emotional support pets because our spirit would be filled with the presence of the Lord.
