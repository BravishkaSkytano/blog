I hate routines,\
I hate the never-ending routines that plague my life.\
Everything is so boring,\
The same every day.<!-- more -->\
I can't escape it,\
All I can do is wait.\
Wait for a break,\
Wait for a chance at freedom.\
Wait. Hope. Pray.

A never-ending, forever boring, schedule of life.\
When will it end?\
Soon?\
Never?\
Lord help me, I can't take this anymore!

But I know, I know,\
I will endure it,\
I have no choice.\
I can't escape.\
Not now,\
Not for years to come.

Give me strength, Father.\
You're the only One who notices,\
You're the only One who understands.\
You are the only One who can help me.\
Abba, please,\
Please help me.\
I beg You,\
Help me break this routine.
