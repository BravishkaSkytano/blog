I winced as another rock hit my skin.\
I feel like it left a mark\
So I check, but find none.\
They didn't use to hurt so much,\
They were smaller, too.<!-- more -->\
At first, they were pebbles\
And I could easily shake 'em off\
But now they've gotten bigger and faster\
They demand my attention.\
And one day, I fear\
They will be so big\
That Death will be there to take me\
When I open my eyes, again.

Flash forward a little,\
Not much has changed.\
I'm still getting hit.\
But now, they seem smaller,\
Or maybe I'm too numb.\
Perhaps my nerves are frozen,\
Or my brain just isn't working.\
I don't recognize how I feel,\
Or who I am.\
It's so confusing.\
I'm lost, again.\
On an endless loop with no end in sight.\
I barely remember what it was like before\
The memories were long buried in snow.\
I wish I could uncover them.\
Bring them back and savor 'em.\
But they're never the same,\
And my mind keeps writing over them.\
What a waste,\
There is never anything new.\
It's the same as last week\
Last month.\
Last year.\
This endless loop just won't disappear.

Sometimes I wonder,\
Why am I fighting?\
What's the purpose?\
Where's the end?\
I can't see the benefit.\
An endless loop is all I see.\
An endless loop that traps me.\
There's no escaping it,\
Doesn't matter where I go.\
It follows me everywhere,\
Maybe I'm just slow.\
What's the purpose of this show?\
I forgot, but maybe you know.\
Will it end?\
Will the ending be great?\
I don't know anymore,\
Nor do I seem to care.\
I don't feel much,\
Besides anger and fear.\
Oh, let's not forget loneliness,\
He seems like the star this year.\
Maybe that's why the rocks don't hurt me.\
It's hard to feel much\
When you're broke and alone.\
Then again, maybe that's the name of this show.
