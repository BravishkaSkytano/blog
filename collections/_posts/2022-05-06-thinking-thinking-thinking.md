Thoughts run around in my head.\
Thinking, thinking, thinking...

In a circle they go,\
Like a hamster in a wheel.\
Thinking, thinking, thinking.
<!-- more -->
Should I stay or should I go?\
Thinking, thinking, thinking...

If I stay, will it continue like it has,\
Getting worse and worse,\
Till I break and snap?\
Thinking, thinking, thinking...

If I go, how will I get out?\
Airplane, bus, train?\
Do I want someone else to pay for that?\
Thinking, thinking, thinking...

I need a phone.\
I need a phone plan.\
I need a job.\
I need an education.\
Thinking, thinking, thinking...

My life sucks.\
So many decisions I have to make,\
How can I make them all?\
Thinking, thinking, thinking...

I've never done this before,\
What if I mess up?\
Thinking, thinking, thinking....

I'm tired of thinking!\
Why is this so hard?\
Around and around I go,\
Thinking, thinking, thinking...

(Sigh) Being an adult isn't easy,\
You're always\
Thinking, thinking, thinking...\
The only difference is that\
You have to decide for yourself.\
You can't rely on your parents.\
Your siblings are just as confused.\
Your friends can't do it either.\
That's why you must always be\
Thinking, thinking, thinking...

Someday soon, it won't be hard.\
Someday soon I won't be alone\
Thinking, thinking, thinking...

But until that day comes,\
I must spend time\
Thinking, thinking, thinking...
