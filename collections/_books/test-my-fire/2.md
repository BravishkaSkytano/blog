# 2. Yeah, I'm Reckless. Get Over It.

"You did what?!"

Zamara winced as Rajar yelled at her.

"Are you out of your mind?! No, don't answer that. That's got to be one of the most reckless things you've ever done in your life! Why do I work with you? Why are you still working here? How is it possible that you're not fired yet?"

She rolled her eyes as he went on and on about how reckless and irresponsible she was. She knew he was right, but in her defense, she was one of the best spies the agency had because of that recklessness.

"Rajar," Zamara interrupted, "are you almost done?"

Rajar glared at her, "What do you think?"

"Please hurry it up, I've already gotten yelled at by The Top and I have a mission to work on."

"See, even The Top notices your recklessness. Remind me again, why aren't you fired yet?"

She rolled her eyes again, "Because I'm good, that's why."

"Good, reckless, and soon to be dead."

"Thank you." She smiled back at him.

"You're absolutely welcome. I'll say something nice at your funeral."

"I'm so happy I'll be dead and won't hear it."

The two continued to glare at each other.

"What did you find out anyway? And did you tell The Top about the connection to your dad's company?" Rajar asked.

Zamara smiled, "He finally asks me, about time."

Rajar rolled his eyes, "My apologies for making you wait, *Ms. Rose.*"

"Well, now, let me see. It is possible, very possible, that Vladimir is indeed our killer."

"Tell me something I don't know."

"But, I don't think he works alone; I think his brothers are all part of it somehow."

"Why? That guy doesn't look like he needs any help."

"Have you seen the way the brothers treat each other? They're close, you can just feel it. Dragomir is the eldest and owner of the company, both Logan and Dorian follow his lead. When you see those three together, Logan and Dorian don't make decisions without Dragomir's approval."

"Sure, to the public eye, but what about their private lives? Do you honestly think that Logan isn't working alone?"

"If he is, Dragomir knows about it and Dorian might as well. Those three seem too close for Logan to hide that."

Rajar sighed, "It doesn't change anything though, if the other two know about it, so what? Logan's still our guy."

"That's *if* they're not involved."

"What are you thinking, Zee?"

"The Phantom has been so hard to track down, what if it's because the Phantom is actually multiple people? If Logan is using his brothers' resources, especially Dragomir's, then it would make sense."

"I guess. And with the Blackstone's popularity, Logan probably has an escape plan, and the resources needed to silence people."

"Exactly. The way I look at it, Dragomir has the money, Dorian has the connections, and Logan does the rest. It's a perfect team."

"Have you told the Top about this?"

Zamara grimaced, "They didn't ask, and I didn't offer."

"Zee, you can't keep hiding this from them."

"I know, I know, it's just thatâ€•"

"You want to avenge your parents, I get it, but the council has a right to know why you're obsessed with this guy, or group."

"They might already know why."

"But they deserve to hear it from you, that builds trust, you know."

"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. I'll tell them, later."

"Fine." Rajar sighed, "What's our next move?"

Zamara winked, "That depends on what Dorian tells me."

"You're still seeing him?"

"Of course," She feigned disbelief, "why in the world would I not? He *is* rich, you know."

Rajar rolled his eyes, "So are you."

"I am not!" Zamara gasped.

"Oh? When did you file for bankruptcy?"

"Shush you, get back to work."

Rajar chuckled, "You're something else."

"I know," She smiled mischievously, "and you don't even know the half of it."

Dorian looked at his watch for the fifth time. *Where is she?* Samantha was late, and she was going to make him late as well. He hated being late, absolutely hated it. The only time he liked being late was when he was making a statement by doing it. He sighed in frustration, *Of all the days she choose to be late...*

"Patience isn't one of your strengths, Dorian."

Dorian turned to his brother and tried to hide his annoyance. "So? I have many more valuable ones."

Dragomir chuckled, "And what do you consider more valuable than patience?"

"Consistency, for one."

"Consistency? Consistency makes you predictable."

Dorian rolled his eyes, "Punctuality."

Dragomir shook his head, "Punctuality over patience?"

"Being punctual is a very good strength." scowled Dorian.

"True." Dragomir sipped on his glass of wine, "but patience is a virtue."

"What's that supposed to mean?" Dorian snapped.

"Look at you, you're getting all stressed out just because Ms. Rose is five minutes late."

"Seven and a half."

Dragomir raised a brow, "See my point?"

"Yes." Dorian sighed through his teeth.

"You don't need to worry so much, the board members should wait for you after all the trouble they've caused."

Dorian scoffed, "I don't care about them, Slater will be there."

"Ah, yes, the prestigious Gavriel Slater. I suppose one wouldn't want to upset him."

"Why do I feel like you're teasing me?"

"Perhaps," Dragomir smirked, "I am."

Dorian scowled at his brother, "Knock it off."

"Do you truly think it wise to bring this Ms. Rose into his presence? Did you hear about the interesting chat she had with Logan?"

"What? You think she's a spy too?"

Dragomir shrugged, "It's possible, very possible."

Dorian turned away, "Then she'll be taken care of accordingly."

"Is that how much her life means to you, Dorian?"

"Why do you care?" Dorian glared back at him.

"It's true then, you do change women like one changes clothes."

Dorian gritted his teeth, "At least I have women."

"And? What good are they to you?"

"For her sake," Dorian sighed, "I hope Samantha isn't a spy."

"Oh?"

"There's something about her that intrigues me, I can't put my finger on it."

"Is it possible that you've found some clothing you do like?"

Dorian shot a look at his brother and walked back to the balcony. He watched the two birds taking a bath in the middle of the garden. Dorian never understood Dragomir's obsession with nature, dozens of flowers lined the twisting pathway through the acre of land. Groves of trees followed after them, apples and oranges, even grapes. It was beautiful, he couldn't deny that but why Dragomir took it upon himself to personally oversee their care still eluded Dorian.

He turned to his brother, "If you took care of women the way you look after your gardening, you'd
be married with kids by now."

Dragomir smiled but said nothing. Dorian turned back to the garden and resisted the urge to glance
at his watch again.

"Dorian."

"Hmm?"

"Whatever you're looking for will never come to you instantly. Be patient and use wisdom, racing after every little ripple will cause you to miss the bigger ripples worth your attention."

Dorian held his brother's gaze for a moment longer before turning back to the two birds playing in the water.

"The only problem," He muttered, "is that I don't know *what* I'm looking for."

A movement to his right caught his eye. Dorian watched as Samantha Rose stepped out of her car. She was on the phone and her gaze met his. She did not smile and he didn't either. Something told him that she wasn't what he was looking for either.
