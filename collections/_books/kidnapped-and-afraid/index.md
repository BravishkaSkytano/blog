Do you know how to tell when you're about to be kidnapped? When someone who looks kinda off and acts kinda off is eyeing you for no apparent reason.

There are a few basic rules to avoid being in this situation and becoming easy prey. First rule: be aware of your surroundings&mdash;the more aware you are the easier you can spot people watching you. Second rule: don't be out at night, alone, on dark streets&mdash;evil enjoys being in darkness, that's where fear can easily infiltrate your mind, and the less eyes around makes it even easier. Third rule: don't *ever* panic&mdash;panicking clouds the mind and causes you to make dumb decisions.

If you ever do get kidnapped, don't panic, think, pay attention, and be ready to act *when the time is right.* Try to recognize your kidnapper's habits and exploit them.

I thought I had mastered these rules. After the first time, I thought that I couldn't be kidnapped ever again. I was wrong, very wrong. And when I got kidnapped the second time, I found out when those rules really couldn't work against him. In a nutshell, it only works on mundane mortals, not immortal beings with enhanced abilities.

Perhaps, its time to rewrite the rules... if I make it out, again.
