# II

It was two days of marching and pillaging before the army was near their final target—Carlhaven, a well-populated city full of many species and cultures. Attacking this city would make a bold statement.

Válgr and his army were full of anticipation for the mighty battle ahead. Every soldier was either sparring or preparing weapons. Any moment now, Válgr would begin giving out orders for the army to march on and destroy the fae stronghold. Azura watched them all with boredom and pity. Válgr hadn't revealed his master plans yet, but she was sure it involved rivers of blood and world enslavement. And all of these men would be drunk on the spoils of war, numb to the reality that their leader was a power-hungry jotunn to the core.

There was once a time when Azura herself would have been the one leading an army of misfits to conquer what no one thought possible. That was back when battles were worth fighting, heroes were bound by honor, and evil waited in every crevice to strike out against the innocent. This war was mainly to please the pride of one jotunn who considered himself above everyone else. In two words: utterly pointless. It was with disgust and anger that Azura was forced to fight under his banner and the reason behind her constant tampering with things. Fights would break out among the ranks, supplies would disappear, weapons rusted, and creatures would ambush the army. Válgr knew it was all her doing and had tried many times to stop her. His hate for her grew each time he failed to fully control her. She had once told him that he might be able to control her body, but he would never control her very essence—her magic. If Válgr could drain out all of it and capture it in a relic, which she was sure he would do in a heartbeat, he still wouldn't be able to control it.

Azura's musings were cut off as Válgr and his generals approached the middle of the camp. Each general represented a different race in Válgr's unique army, five in all. She sighed, there was _always_ a group who hated the masters, even if the masters were generous and interfered little.

Válgr addressed the army, "Tonight, we will send a message to the fae by attacking two of their very own cities."

Azura raised a brow. _Two cities? How ambitious of you, fool._

"Most of us will march on to Carlhaven as planned, while some of you will break off to attack Heathersage. It will be a great surprise to both cities, and the fae will be forced to split their forces. With their power cut off, fear will begin to invade their forces; fear that will only grow when we unleash the _full_ power of our destruction."

Azura grimaced, the emphasis was not lost on her. Válgr was going to try and drain all of her magic in this fight.

"We will bring the fae to their knees and rule over them! It is time we get rid of them once and for all!"

Cheers and battle cries erupted across the plain as the leaders dispersed to their respective tents. Azura watched Válgr enter his and followed after him.

Válgr didn't even glance at her when she entered. _"Why are you attacking Heathersage?"_

He sighed, "Questioning me, again, slave?"

Azura scowled, _"Your army as a whole had a fifty percent chance of overtaking the wall. Now, your chances are slim."_

"If I wanted your opinion, I would have included you in the discussion." Válgr sneered at her, "And you are forgetting the full capabilities of my army."

_"What capabilities?"_ She laughed, _"Your magic is nothing compared to the full force of the fae."_

"And yours?"

She stiffened, _"I am not taking down the walls."_

He growled, "You will do what I tell you too, slave."

_"I am not your slave!"_

Válgr held up his left hand, "My ring says otherwise."

The silver ring seemed to laugh at her as she glared at it. Forged millennia ago, that ring was older than this world, and it seemed like Fate was challenging her by allowing a being such as Válgr to possess it.

_"You will die in this ridiculous war, troll."_ She growled back, _"I hope that Death takes his time with you and that I will get to watch as your soul leaves your body and travels to the Hell Realm in utter agony."_

Válgr chuckled, "Wouldn't you rather do it yourself?"

Azura glared at him before smiling wickedly. _"The fae can be quite cruel when they choose to, their methods of dealing out punishment are quite... inventive. They could torture you for hours on end. And just when you think Death is approaching, they would just heal you and start over."_

He growled, "I do not fear those elves! The jotunns are stronger than some small beings!"

_"Do you? Everyone fears them in one way or another. Who wouldn't fear the Realm Masters who control all? Who KNOW all? Strength does not trump knowledge, nor experience."_

"Is that your plan, then? To let the fae free you from your bondage? You have more reasons to fear them than I, after all, you know their dungeons quite well, don't you?"

Azura only smiled, _"I would love to watch as they carved out your flesh. Tell me, what does your heart look like? How does it beat? What of your blood, how little do you need to be just barely alive? And your bones, how thick are they? I know some fae who would love to see how your body will react under the many types of torture they can conjure up."_

"Get out!" Válgr yelled, "Threaten me again, and I will carve out your flesh myself!"

Azura felt the ring compelling her to leave, but she just laughed, _"You couldn't Válgr and you know it. Isn't that why you hate me so much? You can NEVER control me like you control all others; I am a Thunderbird, a being who thrives on delivering justice, don't forget it. My revenge will be sweet."_

He glared at her as she left his tent.

Azura kept her smile planted on her face as she strode through the camp. She had disobeyed a direct order from the ring, and there would be consequences for that. When the pain hit her, she didn't want to be anywhere near the army. With one last glance, Azura opened her wings and leaped into the air.

She flew two miles before the first wave of pain hit. Azura screamed as her magic turned on her. Her wings failed her. There was no way to soften her fall as she plummeted to the ground. There was no peace in the darkness that overtook her senses, no peace at all.

Válgr smiled to himself and glanced at his hand. The ring burned, and he could feel the pain it was inflicting. _Yes,_ he thought, _remind that witch who her master is._
