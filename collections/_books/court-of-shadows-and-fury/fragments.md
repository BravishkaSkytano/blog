Of all the creatures that existed in the Realms, the fae were one of the more advanced beings for dozens of reasons. Some believed that the fae were one of the first creatures created, and others thought of them as demigods. With their magic and the ability to control the rifts between realms, the fae could be found in nearly every world and controlled the very magic that shaped each reality. No one, except, perhaps, the fae themselves, knew how each world was created, or for what purpose; the exact count of how many even existed was unknown. The study of each world began with classifying its Realm.

There were seven major realms: the Day Realm, the Twilight Realm, the Spirit Realm, the Hell Realm, the Heavenly Realm, the Shadow Realm, and the Nameless Realm. In each of these major realms, there existed several minor realms, often called worlds. The worlds that had at least one sun and experienced periods of days and nights made up the Day Realm. The Twilight Realm was full of worlds that lived in twilight and had what one could consider dying suns. The Spirit Realm, also called the Ghost Realm, housed the restless spirits that had yet to be laid to rest. The next two realms, the Hell Realm and the Heavenly Realms, were collectively referred to as the afterlife. In these worlds, the fallen beings of other realms were given a final resting place for a millennium, after which they faded from existence and were forgotten. The Shadow Realm was made up of the worlds that danced in shadows and wrapped its creatures in the same. The worlds that fit into none of the other realms were placed into the last realm, the Nameless Realm. This realm was considered unstable, and the worlds within it usually didn't exist for long, and the ones that did were largely unknown and mysterious.

In each of these realms, the fae had a strong presence. None of the beings from one realm were allowed to enter another without permission, that preserved the balance. Not all worlds knew of the masters that protected them, or of the existence of other worlds like their own. Some lived in ignorant bliss of each other. The only time the fae revealed themselves was when a world deviated from its sole reality and began to threaten the Realm itself, or another one. In these instances, the fae would intervene and neutralize the threat. Worlds could conquer other worlds, but they must *never* try to conquer, destroy, or change the very essence of their Realm. Realms existed for a reason, and only the fae, and a select few, were allowed to wander from one to another. It had been that way since time began, and it would stay that way until it ended.

Nixarza chuckled at the fae captain's history lesson. How the fae loved to humbly exalt themselves above all others.

Most of what the young captain had said was true, and the slaves to which he spoke hung upon his every word. Like most of the historians of his kind, he failed to explain the ley lines or the Rifts that gave the fae so much power over all the Realms.

It had taken them twelve minutes to reach the nearest ley line, and another ten minutes to reach a stronghold. The fae had strongholds all over each world for this exact purpose. Some were deliberately hidden, while others were kept in plain sight. This one was in the middle of hundreds of acres of forest, with enough room for an entire legion to camp out comfortably. The only structure was a small castle housing food, water, weapons, and other necessities. A few fae lived here and kept it running, along with reporting on the surrounding area's inhabitants.

Nixarza strode through the halls, eyeing tapestries and the intricate work of fae weavers. She idly traced the lines of a tapestry that told a story of an epic battle between some High Lords and their armies that spread out like a sea of ants. Nixarza had been slowly following after Faelyn since he had left her in a room with some other slaves. His only order to wait for his return was quickly ignored, and she took to wandering the hallways. The ignorant prince probably didn't even know she had left the room, the guards she passed by never saw or felt her presence. She smiled, the beings that could elude the fae were few. Nixarza sensed her prince and his second in a chamber on her left, and she didn't hesitate to follow after them.

The two soldiers guarding the door didn't notice as she shadowed through the double doors. *'So much for well-trained guards,'* she chuckled.

In the center of the chamber, Faelyn and Folluin were discussing the battle with the generals. Nixarza counted five of them and noted their faces. There were rumors that the generals of the Shadow Fae's armies were some of the most cunning of all fae; and that was a bold statement, considering that most fae, in general, were considered smart and cunning. She recognized a few faces from earlier battles she had witnessed; but none of them were ancient, and they would not know her. She strode on silent feet towards them and looked over their shoulders. A map was spread out on a table before them. Colored lines crossed through it, and some areas were marked with symbols in the fae tongue. Nixarza recognized the lines as ley lines and the symbols marked strongholds, armies, and a dozen other things. It looked like the jotunn were spreading their forces across the whole map and taking over fae strongholds. Nearly one-third of the map was covered with symbols marking the jotunn and their victories. Nixarza rolled her eyes, the magic-drunk beasts were always warring with someone.

Folluin shifted and addressed the general beside him, "How have you let them get this far? The moment Carlhaven was struck, you should have rallied your forces."

The general scowled, "They attacked both Carlhaven *and* Heathersage Keep at the same time. Neither were expecting such an attack, and my armies were stretched thin trying to defend them both."

"How is that the jotunn were able to gather two large hosts without your knowledge? There must have been a warning."

Another general spoke up, "There was none, my lord. All was silent and peaceful."

Faelyn shook his head, "Impossible, the jotunn do not plan such attacks."

"VÃ¡lgr was a formidable foe, he was smarter than any other jotunn I have come across."

"You haven't lived long, Rothilion, there is much you do not know." Spoke another.

"And you know more, Vulen?" Rothilion snapped back.

"Four centuries is a long time."

"A long, wasted time."

Faelyn slammed his fist on the table, "Enough! Focus on this threat."

Both Vulen and Rothilion bowed and murmured their apologies.
