# Case I: The New Years' Eve Lamb

Homicide Detective Jared Clemmings is asked for his help in a peculiar case about a missing women. What's peculiar about? Well, everything. Cassidy Williams is the happily married wife of Greg Williams, or so it seemed until she disappeared without a trace one morning while her husband was at work. She didn't take anything or leave a note, she never hinted there was something wrong, she just up and left. Officer Robert Johnson thinks it's just another runaway wife case; but Clemmings thinks otherwise--runaways don't leave all their things and valuables when they leave. The husband is convinced that Cassidy didn't leave him and that she was kidnapped, but there isn't any evidence to back up his claim. With no leads, Jared reaches out to a friend who has a knack for finding "invisible" leads.

Zipporah Crusoe has never been too busy to help Jared, her life is very quiet as it is, though when he tells her about this new case something from her past resurfaces. Zipporah isn't sure if her nightmares are truly connected to this case, but if they are, Cassidy Williams may be on her way to death by fire unless Zipporah can figure it out before the sun sets on December 31.

**Objective:** Find Cassidy Williams //
**Countdown:** 7 days
