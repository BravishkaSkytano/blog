"You did what?!"

Zamara winced as Ryan yelled at her.

"Are you out of your mind?! No, don't answer that. That's got to be one of the most reckless things you've ever done in your life! Why do I work with you? Why are you still working here? How is it possible that you're not fired yet?"

She rolled her eyes as he went on and on about how reckless and irresponsible she was. She knew he was right, but in her defense, she was one of the best spies the agency had because of that recklessness.

"Ryan," Zamara interrupted, "are you almost done?"

Ryan glared at her, "What do you think?"

"Please hurry it up, I have a mission to work on."

"How does the The Top not notice your recklessness? Remind me again, why aren't you fired yet?"

She rolled her eyes again, "Because I'm good, that's why."

"Good, reckless, and soon to be dead."

"Thank you." She smiled back at him.

"You're absolutely welcome. I'll say something nice at your funeral."

"I'm so happy I'll be dead and won't hear it."

The two continued to glare at each other before Ryan sighed, "What did you find out anyway?"

Zamara smiled, "He finally asks me, about time."

Ryan rolled his eyes, "My apologies for making you wait, *Ms. Rose.*"

"Well, now, let me see. It is extremely possible, that Dakota is, indeed, our beloved Phantom--"

"Tell me something I don't know."

"--but, I doubt he works alone, his brothers are all part of it somehow."

"Why? That guy doesn't look like he needs any help."

"Have you seen the way the brothers treat each other? They're close, very close. Dragomir is the eldest and owner of the company, both Dakota and Dorian follow his lead. When you see those three together, Dakota and Dorian don't make decisions without Dragomir's approval."

"Sure, to the public eye, but what about their private lives? Do you honestly think that Dakota isn't working alone?"

"If he is, Dragomir definately knows about it and Dorian might as well. They seem too close for Dakota to hide that. Look at where I found those profiles."

"They were behind a high profile secruity system connected to a metal door."

"As if that could be in Dragomir's house and he somehow didn't know about it."

"Which makes him our prime suspect, not Dakota."

"I disagree."

Ryan threw up his hands, "Obviously."

"Dakota spends enough time at that place for that room to be his. Dragomir is much too busy to be our killer, his movements are the easiest to track out of the three brothers."

"But why would Dragomir risk his entire corporation on his brother's obsession with guns and death?"

"There could be dozens of reasons, and he probably has a plan B for if this gets out. Look at the victims, they were not exactly loved by society, no one even thoroughly examines their murders."

"Which would give the Blackstone's the ability to easily quiet anyone who might accidently find out."

"Exactly. The way I see it, Dragomir has the money, Dorian has the connections, Dakota has the skill, and together they share the resources. It's a perfect team, and that would explain why the Phantom has been so hard to track down."

"Have you told The Top about all this?"

Zamara grimaced, "They haven't asked and I haven't offered."

"Z, you can't keep hiding this from them."

"Why not? They will just try to stop me."

"And they've got to know that's pointless by now."

"The Top can be utterly stubborn when they wish to be."

"Interesting, reminds me of someone I know."

"Oh, please, I'm not 'utterly stubborn.'"

"Uh huh, sure. What's our next move, Ms. Slightly Stubborn?"

"That depends," She smiled, "on what Dorian tells me."

"You're still seeing the guy?"

"Of course I am!" She gasped, "Why in the world would I not? He is rich, you know."

Ryan rolled his eyes, "Like you care, you're rich too."

"First off, I am not rich. Second, he's also a born Blackstone, and that's not something money can get you."

"Pfft, and you're a Schnee, so what? And when did you file for bankrupcy?"

"Oh, shush and get back to work."

Ryan chuckled, "You're something else.d"

"I know," Zamara smirked, "and you don't even know the half of it."

Dorian looked at his watch for the fifth time. *Where is she?* Samantha was late, and she was going to make him late as well. He hated being late, absolutely hated it. The only time he liked being late was when he was making a statement by doing it. He sighed in frustration, *Of all the days she choose to be late...*

"Patience isn't one of your strengths, Dorian."

Dorian turned to his brother and tried to hide his annoyance. "So? I have many more valuable ones."

Dragomir chuckled, "And what do you consider more valuable than patience?"

"Consistency, for one."

"Consistency? Consistency makes you predictable."

Dorian rolled his eyes, "Punctuality."

Dragomir shook his head, "Punctuality over patience?"

"Being punctual is a very good strength." scowled Dorian.

"True." Dragomir sipped on his glass of wine, "but patience is a virtue."

"What's that supposed to mean?" Dorian snapped.

"Look at you, you're getting all stressed out just because Ms. Rose is five minutes late."

"Seven and a half."

Dragomir raised a brow, "See my point?"

"Yes." Dorian sighed through his teeth.

"You don't need to worry so much, the board members should wait for you after all the trouble they've caused."

Dorian scoffed, "I don't care about them, Slater will be there."

"Ah, yes, the prestigious Gavriel Slater. I suppose one wouldn't want to upset him."

"Why do I feel like you're teasing me?"

"Perhaps," Dragomir smirked, "I am."

Dorian scowled at his brother, "Knock it off."

"Do you truly think it wise to bring this Ms. Rose into his presence? Did you hear about the interesting chat she had with Dakota?"

"What? You think she's a spy too?"

Dragomir shrugged, "It's possible, very possible."

Dorian turned away, "Then she'll be taken care of accordingly."

"Is that how much her life means to you, Dorian?"

"Why do you care?" Dorian glared back at him.

"It's true then, you do change women like one changes clothes."

Dorian gritted his teeth, "At least I have women."

"And? What good are they to you?"

"For her sake," Dorian sighed, "I hope Samantha isn't a spy."

"Oh?"

"There's something about her that intrigues me, I can't put my finger on it."

"Is it possible that you've found some clothing you do like?"

Dorian shot a look at his brother and walked back to the balcony. He watched the two birds taking a bath in the middle of the garden. Dorian never understood Dragomir's obsession with nature, dozens of flowers lined the twisting pathway through the acre of land. Groves of trees followed after them, apples and oranges, even grapes. It was beautiful, he couldn't deny that but why Dragomir took it upon himself to personally oversee their care still eluded Dorian.

He turned to his brother, "If you took care of women the way you look after your gardening, you'd
be married with kids by now."

Dragomir smiled but said nothing. Dorian turned back to the garden and resisted the urge to glance
at his watch again.

"Dorian."

"Hmm?"

"Whatever you're looking for will never come to you instantly. Be patient and use wisdom, racing after every little ripple will cause you to miss the bigger ripples worth your attention."

Dorian held his brother's gaze for a moment longer before turning back to the two birds playing in the water.

"The only problem," He muttered, "is that I don't know *what* I'm looking for."

A movement to his right caught his eye. Dorian watched as Samantha Rose stepped out of her car. She was on the phone and her gaze met his. She did not smile and he didn't either. Something told him that she wasn't what he was looking for either.
