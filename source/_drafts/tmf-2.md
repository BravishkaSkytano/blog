"You did what?!"

Zamara winced as Rajar yelled at her.

"Are you out of your mind?! No, don't answer that. That's got to be one of the most reckless things you've ever done in your life! Why do I work with you? Why are you still working here? How is it possible that you're not fired yet?"

She rolled her eyes as he went on and on about how reckless and irresponsible she was. She knew he was right, but in her defense, she was one of the best spies the agency had because of that recklessness.

"Rajar," Zamara interrupted, "are you almost done?"

Rajar glared at her, "What do you think?"

"Please hurry it up, I've already gotten yelled at by The Top and I have a mission to work on."

"See, even The Top notices your recklessness. Remind me again, why aren't you fired yet?"

She rolled her eyes again, "Because I'm good, that's why."

"Good, reckless, and soon to be dead."

"Thank you." She smiled back at him.

"You're absolutely welcome. I'll say something nice at your funeral."

"I'm so happy I'll be dead and won't hear it."

The two continued to glare at each other.

"What did you find out anyway? And did you tell The Top about the connection to your dad's company?" Rajar asked.

Zamara smiled, "He finally asks me, about time."

Rajar rolled his eyes, "My apologies for making you wait, *Ms. Rose.*"

"Well, now, let me see. It is possible, very possible, that Vladimir is indeed our killer."

"Tell me something I don't know."

"But, I don't think he works alone; I think his brothers are all part of it somehow."

"Why? That guy doesn't look like he needs any help."

"Have you seen the way the brothers treat each other? They're close, you can just feel it.
