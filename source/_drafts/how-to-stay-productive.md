To start off, I thought it would be good to split this long post into a few sections. Now, this post will probably be updated as I move through the year(s) so look out for those callouts.

First off we are going to be starting with school since that usually comes before a job. Anyway, if you're like me, you have looked at dozens of videos online about how to plan your school year and stay organized because you know you need too. And you probably got overwhelmed and stressed out while watching those videos and gathering these huge nuggets of wisdom that you had no idea how you would actually use them. Yup, been there, done that, and so have thousands of others.

You don't need to beat yourself up for having the urge to get organized and not knowing how to do it. On the flip side, you should probably stop spending hours on social media watching productivity videos and start being productive!

My point is simple, I've been there, and I still am. The whole purpose of this post is to encourage you and help you figure out how to organize your life and increase your productivity. Here are my tips.

## Discover Your Personality Type and Find Your Learning Method

This is really important because it will help you understand what type of person and learner you are. This seemingly small detail could be exactly what's slowing you down and adding to your frustration! And it's an easy fix. No, really, it is!

To discover your personality type, I would proudly recommend [16 Personalities.](https://www.16personalities.com) This site prompts you to take an in-depth, ten-minute quiz to discover what kind of person you are. It's recommended by a bunch of people, schools, and organizations. And it really works! I have learned things about myself that I didn't even know, and it all helped me understand me better. Finding your personality will help you discover your learning type, strengths and weaknesses, career types, job environment, and the type of friends that work best for you (including lovers!). I'm telling you, taking the 16Personalities quiz will be such a big help.

As with all these types of quizzes, take the time to answer the questions truthfully. If you're struggling with one question, just pick the first thing that pops into your head. If you have a sibling or someone who knows really well, you could ask them for help; but remember, no one knows you like you and God do, period.

After you have found your personality type and taken note of your learning method, it's time to move on to the next step: finding the right tool to help organize your life!

## Time To Start Learning How To Organize Your Way

I am not an organized person, I'm pretty sure I've said that already. Therefore, if I can do it, you can *definitely* find your own way to organize your life. This step might take a while, and I mean, *weeks*; but don't let that discourage you because I'm here to help you.

The first step is finding the way that **YOU** organize. Are you someone who uses their phone or tablet a lot? Is paper and pen more productive? Plan around a little and figure that out because it really does matter. For me, I find that there's something about paper, it's easier to access and capture my thoughts. I guess that's the writer in me.
