Gavriel Arturek idly listened to the youngest of the Blackstone men ramble on about... what was he talking about, again? Ah, yes, his newest infatuation, a foreign woman named Samantha Rose.

Gavriel again asked himself why he was listening to the boy in the first place. He kept getting the same answer--Dorian was a Blackstone, and the Blackstones were family. But still, why did Dorian have to bring every woman he was courting to him for approval? Gavriel inwardly sighed to himself, the boy wanted approval from his father figure. Usually, Gavriel was more than happy to advise the Blackstone sons on any matter, however, Dorian's relationship questions came far too quickly for Gavriel's liking. When he allowed himself, he pitied all of the Blackstone children, but Dorian and Cecil were always pitied the most. The father of the children had never really had time for his offspring, nor did he care much about their upbringing. Thomas Blackstone would rather spend his days in his office, or in bed with his wife, than ten minutes bestowing fatherly love to anyone.
