Gavriel Arturek idly listened to the youngest of the Blackstone men ramble on about... what was he talking about, again? Ah, yes, his newest infatuation, a foreign woman named Samantha Rose.

Gavriel again asked himself why he was listening to the boy in the first place. He kept getting the same answer--Dorian was a Blackstone, and the Blackstone's were family. But still, why did Dorian have to bring every woman he was courting to him for approval? Gavriel inwardly sighed to himself, the boy wanted approval from his father figure. Usually, Gavriel was more than happy to advise the Blackstone sons on any matter, however, Dorian's relationship questions came far too quickly for Gavriel's liking. When he allowed himself, he pitied all of the Blackstone children, but Dorian and Cecil were always pitied the most. The father of the children had never really had time for his offspring, nor did he care much about their upbringing. Thomas Blackstone would rather spend his days in his office, or in bed with his wife, than ten minutes bestowing fatherly love to anyone. It was no surprise that when he died, few mourned the man he was. The family, if they mourned at all, only mourned the man he could have been; the man they wished him to be.

Dorian and his younger sister, Cecil, were mere teenagers when their father passed, they were searching for love and acceptance. Gavriel had not known that he would inherit four children when he approached Dragomir, the heir to the family business; but he didn't mind it at all. Gavriel knew very well what might happen to each of them if they didn't have someone to help guide and shape them.

So, Gavriel Arturek never denied assistance to any of the Blackstone's if he could provide it. The Blackstone family was now a strong, close-knit unit of intelligent young men and women thanks to his gentle, but firm, guidance.

His thoughts were interrupted when Dorian called out to someone. Gavriel looked up at the young woman who stood frozen, staring at him. Her mahogany hair was pinned up with small curls dangling down to accent her face. Yet, it was her eyes that held his attention, he could never forget those sharp, green pair of eyes and the woman they belonged to, those eyes would forever haunt him.

Dorian called out to her again and reached out his hand. That broke her trance, and she smiled slightly before placing her hand in his.

"Gavriel, meet Samantha Rose." Dorian proudly declared.

"Ms. Rose." Gavriel pressed a kiss to her hand, "Dorian has been bragging about you for days now, I'm glad I finally get to meet you."

She smiled and nodded at him, "Likewise, Mr. Arturek."

Gavriel smirked. She didn't look pleased at all. Poor Dorian, he had no idea who he was courting. "It would please me very much if you two would join me for lunch tomorrow."

Dorian's grin grew larger, "That would be wonderful."

Ms. Rose frowned, "I'd rather not. Mr. Arturek, but thank you for the offer."

"Samantha..." Dorian grumbled.

She just ignored him, "Please, may we go now? I'm tired."

Dorian grew angry, and looked hurt. "Samantha, why can't--"

"Is that your name," Gavriel interrupted, "*Samantha?*"

Samantha narrowed her eyes at him, "Is *Gavriel* yours?"

"What?" Dorian looked cute confused.

"Why are you here?" Gavriel countered. "What are your intentions with young Dorian?"

"You should ask him," She snapped back, "he's the one with the 'intentions.'"

Gavriel continued to study her. He didn't consider it coincidence that the two had met. The question was simple, was her target one of the Blackstone's or him?

"Enough," Samantha turned and started towards the exit, "I'm leaving, Dorian."

"Ms. Rose."

She turned back towards Gavriel, her green eyes glaring at him.

"The Blackstone's are dear friends of mine," Gavriel glared back at her, "If you harm them, I will finish what we started those years ago."

She smiled, "Don't worry, Gavriel, I only go after people who deserve it."

With that, she walked through the double doors, out of sight.

"Be careful with that one," Gavriel murmured to Dorian, "She's just humoring you."

"It sounded like she's using me." Dorian murmured back.

"Could be both."

"How do you know her?"

Gavriel sighed, "That's a story for another time, I must retire, as well."

Dorian nodded, even while disappointment painted his face, and bid Gavriel goodnight. Gavriel exited the double doors. His driver was already parked outside, waiting for him, and the man opened the car door. But before Gavriel stepped inside, he felt eyes watching him. He smiled and turned to his left. Samantha's emerald eyes bared into his. Gavriel nodded to her and finally entered the limo. He grabbed his cellphone and speed-dialed his head of security.

"Sir?"

"Tell Logan to be in my office in half an hour."

"Yes, sir."

"And get me information on a woman named Samantha Rose."
