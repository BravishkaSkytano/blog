{% note %}
This is a thriller that came to me one day when I was trying to start being serious about my writing. Honestly, I keep getting stuck with this one. Many scenes will just come to me, the difficulty lies in connecting those scenes and adding proper transitions. I do feel like it's an interesting story, one where even I am guessing at the ending.

I’m got kidnapped by a stranger who seems to enjoy feeding off of my fear. He won’t let me go but I’m free to escape just so he can drag me back again.

At first, I think he’s a psychopath, but then he starts doing things that seem impossible. Can he really read my mind? How does his eye color change so fast? Is he manipulating my emotions? Why doesn’t he seem to sleep? Why does he keep me imprisoned? Nothing makes sense and the more I dig the more confusing it gets.

He’s not a vampire. He’s not affected by blood, has no problem stalking me during the daylight, and lacks the fangs. He isn’t fae, no pointy ears. He can’t possibly be a werewolf, full moons have come and gone with no change. So, what is he? An alien? Who is he? And how will I finally escape him? Will I ever escape him?
