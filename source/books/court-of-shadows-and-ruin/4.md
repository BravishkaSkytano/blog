Azura was used to watching a batlle from the skies, but this one was... interesting. What had given the Lesser Army an advantage against all their enemies was their unique lack of strategy. Each army acted, mostly, independant of each other; both were working towards the same goal, just using their own methods. There was no strategizing between armies, no organizing, nothing; it was chaos. And from her perch in the sky, Azura kept watch on all this chaos, and made sure it was all going towards the right direction, while staying hidden in the clouds. She sighed, despite her unwillingness to participate in this particular war, she wanted to do something; even her magic ached to be released. Watching from the sky was boring, she'd rather be fighting something. Sadly, the only beings in the sky were the gargoyles and the few jotunn that towered above the ground. Azura sighed again, *boring.* Her magic fluttered and her eyes caught a flash of light zip across the ground. She smirked, the ley lines were being activated, things were about to get more interesting.

Azura's smirk only grew when the first fae appeared, dressed in the greys of the Shadow Court. *Looks like Válgr got much more than he bargained for.* She laughed.

Speaking of the jotunn, his boasting turned into bellowing when he noticied the small band of fae quickly tearing through his forces. The warriors of the Shadow Court, though few, were the most elite of the fae; no court surpassed their skill and cunning. Válgr had great reason to apnic. And he did, summoning her at once.

Azura landed next him, *"Is something wrong, oh great commander?"*

Válgr growled and swung at her, "Why is the Shadow Court here, witch!"

Azura easily dance away from him, *"To test the might of the mighty Válgr, perhaps?"*

"They would've sent another court, any other court! Not their elite!"

Azura shrugged, *"They're bored, perhaps."*

"You and your 'perhaps!' They wouldn't have sent their elite unless they *knew* you were here."

Azura shrugged again, *"One cannot keep such secrets from the fae that easily."*

"You-"

"Válgr!" shrieked a gargoyle, "What are we to do? We are being plowed through like wheat!"

Azura scoffed, being plowed like wheat by beings who couldn't go higher than eight feet? Despicable.

"We must retreat!" cried an ogre, "Retreat or die!"

"No!" Válgr turned to Azura, "You caused this, and you will fix it."

Azura feigned innocence, *"I have done nothing."*

"Perhaps *that* is what you did wrong."

*"I'm your solution to everything, aren't I? You're not that powerful, are you Válgr?"*

"Go." He growled.

Azura rolled her eyes, laughed, and took off. It wasn't that she didn't want to get close to the Shadow fae, she just didn't want it to be on someone else's terms. She smiled, it didn't matter, it was time to let the Realms that she, the Queen of the Thunderbirds was alive. The Thunderbirds had returned.

Azura didn't even try to hide as she flew over the Shadow fae.
