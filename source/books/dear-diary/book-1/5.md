Brandon Adler watched his son. It didn't seem like Caden had known about Ms. Beckett's true
identity, though the boy was a good actor when he wished to be.

Caden shifted, "Is that why Jennifer is terrorizing her?"

"Perhaps," He took a sip of his coffee, "She recognized Ms. Beckett immediately."

"And this matters because?"

Brandon fought the urge to throttle his son. Arrogant as he was, Caden was truly very smart when he
wished to be. But their relationship hadn't been good lately, Caden would use anything to be angry
at his father and widen the gulf between them. So, Brandon took a deep breath and calmed himself.

"It matters because the Broadmoor's could very well be alive, and we don't know what their daughter
knows."

"Big deal, if you didn't screw up the family name even further, this wouldn't matter."

Ice coated Brandon's veins, the arrogance of this boy was astounding. "Watch your tongue."

"Why? Isn't it common knowledge? Or are you still trying to cover it up?"

Brandon glared at his son, "That 'common knowledge' could destroy *you*."

Caden rolled his eyes, "Funny, I thought Jennifer would be your named heir by now since she's so
obedient and shadows you completely."
