Mysteries are my favorite! I love reading them. I love watching them. I. Love. Mysteries. Period. Which just makes it weird that I have so much trouble writing one! It took months for me to come up with the idea for this one, and it started off as a short story. I got so excited writing it, then I had the idea for the bigger story. I can't wait for this to be finished!

Thanks to this I'm going to try a new writing plan. Basically, I will try to write one or two short stories a month. I hear it's good practice and helps exercise your imagination. I have heard it said many times and I do believe that short stories are a good way to start your writing journey. Perhaps, that's why I'm having trouble with my other stories...

Homicide Detective Jared Clemmings has been working with the Boise Police Department for six years at the top of his class. He grew up on the streets and has connections in nearly every corner. There's no other job he'd rather have and no other place he'd rather live.

Reila Pru is tired of running around the country to escape her past ghosts, and Boise, Idaho looks like the perfect place to finally settle down and enjoy life. Unfortunately, ghosts always return to haunt you until they're put to rest, and she has some big and scary ones.

Together, the two get tangled up in kidnappings, murders, and political scandals that all seem to be dangerously connected. Someone, somewhere, is using them to reveal secrets that have been laid down for years and are tangled in ways that effects the whole city, and maybe even the entire country. The keys to unlock and untangle all of them lie in Reila Pru's past and connections, if she has the courage to face those ghosts and find them.
