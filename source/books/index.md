These are drafts that I work on in my free time, unless otherwise noted. You may read them, but do not expect them to be finished, or free of errors and plot holes.

Also, I have the tendency to change chapters, or remove them completely. I doubt this is a big deal since no one really reads them (yet), but just in case someone is reading this, don't say I didn't warn you.

I write using [Draft](https://draftin.com), check it out!
