The general studied the army approaching Carlhaven's borders. His own army waited down below for the first defensive wave. The sun was slowly disappearing from the horizon, and it was predicted that the advancing forces would reach the outer border when the sun finally disappeared. The captain scowled, this battle wouldn't last far into the night, a complete waste of time; but if the lessors wished to test the might of the fae, Rothilion Ennan will be happy to oblige.<!-- more -->

"General?"

Rothilion turned to the soldier, "What?"

The soldier handed him a letter, "The Shadow Court has sent word."

Rothilion scanned through the letter, "When was this delivered?"

"Just now, sir, I rushed it to you immediately."

"The Shadow Court thinks we need assistance with these lessors." Rothilion growled.

"Sir?"

"Those lessors have an ancient weapon, one so old that Vulas Farwynn's son is coming to assist us."

"This angers you, sir?"

"Of course it does!" Rothilion snapped, "Carlhaven has _never_ needed assistance to defend its own border! These walls have stood for centuries, an army of lessors isn't going to change that. For the Shadow Court to be sending their own army suggests that the lessors are stronger than I."

"What will you do about it?"

"The Shadow Court has spoken, there is nothing I can do other than obey orders. But..." He thought for a moment, "Prepare my horse and the defenders, we will not wait for them to arrive."

The soldier bowed, "Yes, sir."

From her viewpoint in the clouds, Azura could see Carlhaven in all its glory, without being spotted by the mighty towers. The multi-level fortress had some of the strongest reinforced walls she had ever seen. It had grown much in the last seven centuries, when it was merely a village. She had watched the first walls rise up, and even helped with development. Now, that small village had grown into a thriving stronghold that rivaled those older than it. Nixarza sighed, she could not, would not, destroy those walls.

A slight tug called her back down to Válgr's side. She had barely landed before he began questioning her. "How thick are the walls?"

_"Thicker than your skull."_ She replied sweetly.

"And how thick is that?" Válgr growled back.

She smiled, _"Thicker than average."_

"Stop with the games! Can you destroy them or not?"

_"No"_

Válgr glared at her, "You cannot, or you will not?"

_"Does it matter?"_

He grabbed her by the throat, "I do not care how you get my army through those walls, but if they fail, I will gut you, slowly."

She growled, _"Try me, troll."_

"There are many ways I could make you beg for mercy."

Azura broke his grip, _"Do not forget, I am an Ancient."_

"And yet," he smirked, "you are _my_ slave."

_"Not for long, troll. Mark my words, you won't live to see many more battles."_

Válgr laughed, "Who's going to kill me?"

Faelynn Farwynn, High Prince of the Shadow Court, and his second, Folluin Zingolor, prepared their small army of about four hundred elite warriors. All were dressed in the traditional grays of the Shadow Court and equipped with twin ebony blades. Those with higher ranks, like Faelyn and Folluin also bore scythes crafted with the finest metals. Together, they waited to open the ley lines and join the battle.

"When will the ley lines be opened?" Folluin asked his Prince.

"When the walls of Carlhaven are breached." Faelynn replied.

"You expect Rothilion to fail?"

"Rothilion Ennan is a capable general, but his pride constantly blinds him."

"Does it truly matter? These are Lessers, why are we wasting our time with them?"

Faelynn raised a brow, "You have better things to do?"

"Of course," Folluin smiled, "Lady Lyrei"

Faelynn chuckled, "As if."

Folluin feigned pain, "You have hurt me, my prince. She is truly interested in my... abilities"

"Oh, really? What abilities?"

"Am I not desirable?"

Faelynn made a show of examing his second, "Perhaps... it's hard to say."

Both faes laughed, "How cruel of you, Prince." Folluin chuckled.

Faelynn just laughed. "But, regarding the matters at hand."

"Yes, Sire, that."

"There are rumors that an Ancient fights with the Lessers, a being said to have been created in the Nameless Realm."

"And why are we being sent?"

Faelyn turned to his second, "An Ancient fights with the enemy, a being said to have been created in the Nameless Realm."

"An Ancient from the Nameless Realm? I have not heard of this."

"The Ancient's creation and very existence have been shrouded in secrecy and mere speculation, even I did not know of this until a few hours ago. It was thought that its rare kind was annihilated millennia ago, yet this one remains and has been hiding in secret."

"Have you seen it?"

"No, but my father has."

"What else do you know?"

"It is a matter for the Circle and the Circle only, even I know very little."

Folluin nodded, "If that is all we know, We are in for a true battle."

A cry went up among the ranks, Carlhaven's walls had been breached, and the ley lines were to be activated immediately."

"Yes," Faelyn agreed, "a true battle indeed."
