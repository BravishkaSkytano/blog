Good morning, my queen

I was laying here, thinking about my blessings 🥺 and I just want you to know, you are one of many 😘 who I thought, I would never stand a chance with, God changed that around and put you in my life, and we're planning on getting married ❤️ sometimes we don't see, what's right in front of us, because we're to bound, by the things happening around us. But God is saying, if you want a blessing, I'll give you one, that'll change your life. And you have 😭<!--more--> you have been such, a wonder girlfriend, soon to be fiance/wife 🥺 God just really restored everything, I let go of. And I'm praying, God will continue to bless you 😊 there for the longest time, I felt like one of those dry bones in Ezekiel's vision in Ezekiel 37. I was just needing someone to remind me, to rise up. And we have together. We've gotten stronger, encouraged, and we're in love. I don't know what I'd do without you, I know before we started talking here. Suicide crossed my mind. I didn't want to be here. Hurt and pain flooded my life. But right now, I'm blocking that out, with your love and affection, your encouragement, and compassion, and you being my bride 💍 blessings come in different ways, but mine came from one single message from twitch private chat, to messages in the discord, to us being here, from a gift and blessing from God 👑💍 I just know, I'm ready to spend Thanksgiving and Christmas with you 😘 and new years with my blessing and queen 👑

"Sometimes blessings, come right at the breaking point. Because, God has something great, to begin with that person he sends." @DrEncouragement from the title (Love & Blessings 2014)

I love you & God bless you my queen 😘💍

~ Your King 🥺👑💍 ~

My love,

The original, was exactly 32 paragraphs long. And would have sent in multiple sections 🤪 but I shortened it up. To just these few.

Please be expecting my feelings here soon 😘 not my vowels. But my feelings about you. There are more 🥺 just I want to get them all together, it'll make you happy, smile, probably horny 🙈 or it can bring happy tears, and closeness to us both 💕💍

But this love note, just expresses. Everything. Some feelings. Some things, I'm looking forward too. And just about us. Your all I can think about, because without you and God. My life, wouldn't be here. I'd me laid, in a grave. I'm so thankful for you.

I've never been happy, I've never had anyone. I could express my feelings too, till I got with you. I say this, everytime I write this. A part of me, was restored, when it was lost. I've found, a girl, I love, I care about, and definitely worry about. I know your finishing school, so that's why we don't talk alot 😥 but I worry about you when we don't.

My relationship with you, has been amazing, blessed, and healing. We love each other, in a way. I've never loved someone. I'm proud about it. God has been so grateful.

I try not to get horny, all the time while talking to my queen. That is one thing, I'm working on daily. Because, my love, is so much more to you. Than just sex. She's my baby girl, my best-friend, fiance and wife, mother ❤️

I just don't want to be to much, for you my love. But I do enjoy, every every day, and night that we try and talk 🥺 thou I do miss, our late nights.

I've been thinking about, having a Bible study with you 😘 here with in the next few days or so. Maybe we can video chat, and talk. Admire each other 😊

Also, I've been thinking about our gaming room 😁 I'd love to have a photo portrait of us in the background, with neon lights, placed around it 😇 and a beautiful intro, we can say together 🥺

Finally, when my queen gets here 😍 not only are we going to fix up the  house, to our liking 🥰 I do wanna take my queen out, and let her choose a car or truck that she wants me to have 💍

I really want an open relationship, not like my previous relationships. But open as if something is bothering us, I'd love for us to talk about it 🥺 fix it, and continue to love each other. If we wanted to go out and do stuff, we could save up and do that ☺️

I know, if my queen wanted to save up. And move out of the USA. We'd do that 😜 because I wanna be were ever my queen wants us to be 💍

I know, this wake up note is alittle different than the others.

I love you, and forever I promise too 💍👑

~ Soon To Be Fiance 💍😘 ~

Ps: I'm rooting for you, you can do it. We both go through storms, but we always find each other in the midst. I'm not going anywhere. No storm, is to strong that we can't withstand. Because we can. You can 🥺💍 your the strongest person I know, and love 😘
