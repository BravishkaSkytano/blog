Yoela O.:
My day was... fine. I felt left out and lonely at church. I would've texted you, but I was trying to be involved for my siblings 😢

I feel like I don't belong there anymore and it hurts
<!--more-->
The youth had fellowship and I watched as my siblings had fun and I just stood on the sidelines. I'm too old apparently 🙄 but I barely get to participate in the YA minstry

Rickey Whitlow:
Baby, I can't wait to get you here 🥺 so you can get involved with the youth here 😘 and I know how it feels, about not feeling like you belong. It does hurt. But my baby girl, can always get involved with me 💍 and the youth here

Yoela O.:
I don't have enough hope for the future 😞 I feel like something will happen, like always, and we won't be together 😭 something always happens, that's why I don't want to get into relationships. I always get hurt, and I hurt others too

Rickey Whitlow:
I haven't hurt you baby, I'm still here 😘 and I have hope for that future 💍

Yoela O.:
I can't do what I really want, there's always an obstacle. I can't date because my mom won't let me. I can't leave because I have no money. I can't get a job because I haven't graduated. Graduating is taking forever because I'm so discouraged and depressed 😭

Sometimes I think that I will really hurt you someday by being forced to leave 😭 If my mom were to find out about us, she'd take my phone and I'll probably never get it back. We will be separated forever 😭

Rickey Whitlow:
Listen to me baby, you can do this. You can do this, because I know you can. Satan is trying to convince you, it's impossible, it's not worth it, give up and die. But I'm right here, give your cares to God. Discouragement has to flee, depression, stress, parental control over your life, has to go, cast it right now in Jesus name! You have athority over your own life. Your a child of God, don't let yourself live in fear. But stand up against it. Your my queen, my baby girl, and I know without a shadow of doubt. That you can do this, because you know? You may feel bound, like Paul and Silas did. But continue to praise, and make noise! God is about to turn that situation around for you, just like he did Paul and Silas. I love you so much

Yoela O.:
I have authority over nothing. I have been praying, begging, crying out to God for YEARS! He hasn't changed this situation, and it hasn't gotten much easier. I'm not sure why He hasn't, but I feel myself drifting away from Him.

Rickey Whitlow:
God didn't stick you and I together, for nothing. And I'm not planning on giving up. As long as you reply, when you can. I'm gonna be here, for my queen 😘 and sometimes you just need a prayer partner

Yoela O.:
I don't want to fight anymore, what's the freaking use of it all? I never win, I'm never free, and it sure as hell doesn't get easier. There's always something, ever fucking time

Rickey Whitlow:
Someone you can rely on, when you feel down and out. Someone you can turn too, for love and affection. I love you Yoela, more than ground beneath my feet. Just stick with me, God's word said, I'll never leave you nor forsake you. And I'm not leaving you either

I love you 🥺💍 think of me, I'm right here. Calm down. Plz?

Yoela O.:
You should leave me, I wouldn't blame you or hold it against you. It will save you a lot of pain, I'm sure of it

Rickey Whitlow:
I'm not leaving, not at all. Nope. I'm good

My queen is my queen, I promised I'd love you, through thick and thin, for better and worse, and through good and bad times. We're not even married, but I still stand on them

Yoela O.:
The chances of this ending well are slim, very slim. I don't want you to get hurt like everyone else

You're the only one who has ever made that promise. Everyone else has left me, I really want to believe nothing will come between us, but its hard. I just don't have the blessing of being happy for long

Rickey Whitlow:
Your my angel, a promise is to be kept. I said, I'm not easy to get rid of. I've got faith, that nothing will. God has, something for you. He's just really, waiting for you, to reach out and grab ahold of it. I already claimed it, but will you?

Yoela O.:
I want to, but I don't know how

Rickey Whitlow:
Your not the only relationship, I've fought for. I lost one, to her grandparents doing that. But I'm not losing you, because of it. Love stays and fights, love gets knocked down, but it also gets back up and continues fighting. Your not alone, I'm right here

Your a overcomer, apply the blood over your situation. You see, you want happiness? Apply the blood, the devil can't cross over that bloodline. You want a future with me, apply the blood, the devil can't cross the blood line. I plead the back, in Jesus name

Yoela O.:
I love you

And I don't want anything to change that, ever

Rickey Whitlow:
I love you too, I'll have your back, if you have mine. Do me a favor, and write down things. Then put, I plead the blood, and pray over that list every night. And see what God will do, pray without ceasing. What does without ceasing mean? Don't stop. I love you 💍🥺

Yoela O.:
Yes, my king, I will do that

Rickey Whitlow:
When I pray, I literally weep. God help me, I'm in a situation, and I can't get out of this mess by myself. Help me, give me courage. And you know, he does

I just almost sent you the wrong gif 😜🤤 hehe. But your not praying alone, know you have a praying boyfriend too

Yoela O.:
Perhaps I need to weep more, instead of bottling it up and pretending I'm okay. That's not exactly having faith

🥺💍💋

Rickey Whitlow:
Bottling it up, gets you no where. It really doesn't. But faith, casting your cares upon the cross, shows God I'm giving it all over to you

Yoela O.:
I love you, DrEncouragement 💋❤‍🔥

Rickey Whitlow:
I love you more, Mrs Encouragement 👑💍😘

Good morning my queen,

I'm not sure, why I'm saying this. But the shower sorta made my stomach ease up some 😘

But that's not what this is for 🥺 I enjoyed tonight, we talked about a subject we haven't talked about in a long time, the Bible ❤️ I learned a lot from you tonight, and I plan on learning more 🥰 tonight was a great Bible chat, maybe somewhat of a Bible study. I can't wait to do that more with you here, I'd love to have my girl, pick titles out for me at times 💍 and just grow spiritually in God together. Tonight was such, a inspiration. We didn't get horny, well almost. But we kept it right on, the subject of the Bible. I'm so glad, I have you as mine 😍 I truly mean that. You keep me in line, your not afraid to state your opinion, but most of all we're on the same page 💍 your everything I prayed for, and I try to be everything that you want. I love talking to you, about anything and everything. Because, we get it 😊 I mentioned, that I only had a pastor I looked up too at Greater Rain. But I also have a girlfriend, I love and cherish so much, that I can look up to her too ❤️ thank you for letting me, help you, for being my girlfriend, and who God designed you to be. I love you, more than the earth beneath my feet. And I'll forever be grateful, and can't wait to further our lives together 😘

~ Your King 🥺👑💍 ~
