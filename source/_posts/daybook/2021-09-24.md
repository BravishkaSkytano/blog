I finally got to go to MVMNT!!! Then, I found out that CJ and Khasi are leaving! They received an offer to lead a youth ministry at a church in Rochester 😢. I was able to go to the party BTYM was hosting for them so win!

Guess who was there... ☺️. Josh. And he was so happy to see me. He hasn't stopped thinking about me since we stopped chatting. He kept talking about how beautiful I was and how he loved me 🥰. I was so nervous and thankful that Malkiya hadn't come beacause what happened later... Oh. My. Gosh.

After BTYM ended at 8:30, I took a whole sandwich plater to the car 😁. Berenise was so happy, less food for her to worry about. Then I went to go hang out with MVMNT. Josh tagged along of course, he is so smittened. He wouldn't let me leave until I figured out how to contact him and... until we kissed 😶. I was so, just, nervous, anxious, scared, a bundle of nerves! We didn't actually kiss but... well, we touched lips... and his hands were on my ass... ohmigosh I kinda wished I had just kissed him for goodness sakes!

Mom was too tired to ask me anything on the way home. I felt a little bad and helped her get to bed.

I know what I'll be thinking about for a long time...
