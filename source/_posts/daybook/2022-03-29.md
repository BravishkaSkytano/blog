My queen 👑

As I lay here, I wonder how our future will be 😍 I had a dream the last few nights, of us opening the church and we had a major revival ❤️ it continues, and our baby wants to learn how to play the piano, so we buy one 🥺 and we just grow spiritually in God.<!--more--> I had a dream last night, that we had our wedding by the oceans in Africa ☺️ I'm not sure why, I had a dream about it being in Africa. But it was about Africa, and we just had it there because of the wildlife in the midst 🥺 every thing about you is perfect, and every dream I have of you, is amazing 🤩 and I really can't wait to start our future, and go traveling together 😘 if anything more I want to do, it's be with you. Because I know, God has something great to do with us 💍 my life didn't have no meaning. Till my love for you, showed up and we fell in love with each other 😘🥺👑💍

Your Love 💕💍

My king 👑

Whenever I feel like I just want to quit, I think of you. Before you, life was meaningless and hopeless to me; but now, I've begun to have a little hope and I enjoy picturing our future together. It's still difficult for me to believe that we will be together soon, the doubts in my mind are constantly trying to take away that small happiness I have. But even though it's difficult for me to picture a wonderful future together, I still hope for it every day. I can't wait for us to be together, so that I can chase away all the doubts and prove to myself that I do deserve to hope and to love.

Thank you for loving me, and giving me that hope and happiness. Without you, I truly don't know what I would be like, definately not okay and stable. I love you so much 💋❤‍🔥

Your Queen 👑💍
