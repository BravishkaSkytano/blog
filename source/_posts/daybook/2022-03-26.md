Good morning my love,

It's officially been 1 month, almost 2 of us being together (it feels like a few years) 😍 and I wanted to write you, to let you know. It's never been a duel moment being with you ❤️ I know this is God sent, and I can't wait for things to settle down with us and your here 🥰 I think about you every day, because your the one person who makes me happy 🥺<!--more--> our subjects we talk about are so serious, but yet romantic and horny at the same time 🤪 I'm still trying to figure out how we fit all three of them in while we're talking, but we do 😂 babe, every single moment I spend with you, I realize, who I want to be with and grow old with 💍 I want you, because God gave me you, we were both hurting and on the verge of quitting and giving up, but we met in a twitch chat 👑 and we wound up here, in love and cherishing each other 😊 I'm ready to open up everything we want to do, have our kids and seeing them run around screaming in church, seeing my girl in ministry 💒 I don't know what else to ask for, besides Lord I wish my girlfriend was here with me now 🥺 our wedding day, at a river seeing you wearing your dress, makes me tear up every time 😭 because I know I'm marrying my best friend and love of my life, she's everything in one 🙈 and I can't wait to kiss you in person, then hear the preacher say, you may now kiss the bride 💍 because I do 🔥 I love you forever and ever 👑💍

~ Your King 😘 ~
