Mom drove me all the way to Buffalo, NY to get my passport. The people here are nice and respectable, just like the South.

12:30 — We were able to get the photo done at Walgreens.

13:06 — arrived at passport agency. They were very quick, I'm talking ten minutes quick! The appointment was at 1 pm and I have to come back in an hour-and-a-half to pick up my card and my book. I can't wait to see it!

14:13 ― it looks so beautiful! I can't believe I had a passport now! Yes!
