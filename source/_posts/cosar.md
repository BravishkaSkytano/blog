Trust. Treachery. Deception.

Nearly two millennia ago, the Shadow Court was formed, and what was then ruled by the Thunderbirds fell under the control of Vulas Farwynn. The Shadow Court, known for the most dangerous and deadly creatures, with guidance from the deadliest fae alive grew into a symbol of the fae's superiority and strength.

Much of the Shadow Court's beginnings are shrouded in myths and suspicions, but it all began with one fae---Vulas Farwynn---and the annihilation of an entire race. When whispers of their return reach the Shadow Court, the High Lord tasks his son, the High Prince Faelynn Farwynn, with discovering the truth. This task could not have come at a better time, for the young prince has grown restless and is eager for a challenge. However, things change when the whispers are not only confirmed, but Faelynn comes face-to-face with the being; and she has a score to settle with the High Lord of the Shadow Court. And she will settle it, even if she has to kill the entire court.

During the centuries, Azura has only longed for one thing---to avenge the death of her people and give them rest. Nearly one millennium ago, the fae came with talks of peace and friendship; but left with enough bloodshed to cover the planet. The massacre had lasted three days. Azura could still remember the blood-soaked fields, the broken bodies, the screams of terror. For nearly a millennium, she carried those horrors in her mind, the only relief being that she would avenge it all. The fae unleashed a great evil that day, an evil that only her and her people themselves had known about. And Azura was the only one who could stop it... after, of course, she enacted a different type of evil over the Shadow Court.

### Realms vs Courts

Realms are like universes, each realm has multiple planets that share similar characteristics. Courts are the groups of fae that rule over a specific realm. There may be multiple courts in one realm, but they generally only belong to one realm.

Realm = universe \
Court = government

<!--
At age 439, Azura watched [Vulas Farwynn](#Vulas-Farwynn) murder her family and her entire race. Since that night, she has vowed revenge on the High Lord of the Shadow Court. She plans to make him watch his Court fall apart, just as he had done to her father.

At age 792, Azura was captured by [Válgr](#Valgr), a jotunn who sought to use her for his own agenda. She was then bound and controlled by a ring magically linked to a set of two bracelets and two anklets an old friend had given her. Despite this, she still found ways to defy Válgr. The two may have a common enemy, but Azura has made it clear that she is only interested in punishing the guilty ones, not an entire race.

Her first encounter with Vulas Farwynn's son, [Faelynn](#Faelynn-Farwynn), has her questioning her plans. Faelyn is... unique. She isn't sure what it is about the young prince that fascinates her, but he is different from his father. She keeps telling herself that she is only interested in Faelyn because of his father; yet her mind, and her body, hint at the real truth she doesn't wish to accept. But, denying the thin bond that ties her to him is no easy task, nor can its existence be ignored for much longer.

<!--
All his life, Faelynn Farwynn has sought one thing, his father's approval. Living under the shadow of his father has been difficult. As the Lord of the Shadow Court, and the High Lord's Firstborn he has a great reputation to uphold. Everyone expects him to be ruthless, like his father, which is saying much since most fae are considered ruthless. The things his father has done have truly given the word "ruthless" a new meaning. Faelynn has never had a problem with cruelty, but the time for the brand of ruthlessness the Shadow Court is known for his past. The real enemies have passed, no one dare threatens the Shadow Court except the petty beings that, like ants, spring up every century. Except for now...

Faelynn thought he knew everything about being ruthless, but when he hears what his father has done... that is past ruthless, even dishonorable. But is it true? Or is the blue-eyed, white-haired woman that he can't get out of his thoughts lying?
