  Our struggles in our lives can be described as either a stream, a river, or a
  rapid. Come, see what I mean.

Look at the slow, calm streams. Watch as it just flows downhill without a care in the world. It is at peace with itself and flows wherever the hill and the surrounding area take it. Soon, the stream will grow into a river and begin to move faster. The river will now start to carry rocks and small objects with it through its course. As time goes on, it will start to rain and the river will start to flood its banks. As the river floods, it will move faster and faster until it becomes a dangerous rapid. Now, the small stream has grown into a force that can completely reshape its environment. Many fear the rapid and it’s strong currents, however, some see it as a mighty beast waiting to be defeated.

This body of water is a description of our lives. As children, we are nothing more than a small, fairly harmless stream that is easily shaped by the things around it. We are easily influenced and easily broken. We trust easily and learn to see the world around us through the eyes of our parents and our families. As we grow into teenagers, we become a river. Now, we have the force to influence those around us and reshape our world. We begin to find ourselves and discover what it means to be a person. We learn more and experience much. We influence everything around us and have the power to begin charting our courses. When we finally grow into adults, we become the rapid. Now, we are a force to be reckoned with, we chart our own destinies and begin our own journeys. We hurry to fulfill our dreams and discover our passions. We are unstoppable. Yet, this body of water is so much more than just an allegory to our lives, for it shows us what to expect in the coming days.

Look back at the small stream, picture it as it first begins to trickle down the mountain. It is barely noticeable and appears quite harmless, just like the first trials we endure in our lives. Think back to the first time you struggled with something. It was probably a small, insignificant thing,  you may not even remember the details. That would be one of the many small streams we come across in our lives. Some may never grow into a river, others might become fast-moving rapids seeking to drag you into its mighty waters and drown you under its waves. Streams are a daily part of our lives, one that will only cease when we reach our final day on this earth.
If streams are the small tests we go through, then rivers are the trials we experience. Rivers are faster than streams and have the power to slowly shape the ground. Rivers vary in size, but many are long and easy to see. They can go on for miles without slowing, carrying with it whatever happens to be in its path. Rivers are those situations that impact our lives and slowly change us into a more complex person. Just like not all rivers are dangerous, the rivers in our lives should not be feared. Some examples of these rivers would be the relationships you had that ended and left you in tears or that big move that put you in a new city in a new school. These rivers can have a big impact, but they are generally short-lived.

Lastly, we have the greatest body of water in our lives, the rapid. Rapids are feared for many reasons, they are very powerful, deadly, and have the strength to kill us. The rapids in our lives can drag us down and suffocate us. Rapids are very powerful and can greatly change it’s environment, the same applies in our lives. Just like rivers, what we may consider a rapid might not be a rapid to others. Think of something that happened in your life that was a great challenge for you, it was probably an emotional one. Rapids usually last a while and they may feel like an endless battle. The rapids of suicide and depression are two that many people encounter.
