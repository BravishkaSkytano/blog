    (Her)

    He killed my parents, not to mention dozens of other people. He’s only known by the Phantom but I will uncover his identity and make him pay. I’m good at this game and I’ll play it till I die. The Phantom thinks he’s good, but he hasn’t met me yet. I play with fire, live in it really. That’s why I’m called the Phoenix Fox. The fire may burn me, but I will extinguish it before it can kill me.
  
    (Him)
  
    Yes, I’m a killer and I’m good at it. Hundreds have tried to find me, none have succeeded and that’s the way I like it. I wasn’t named “The Phantom’’ for nothing. Those who have gotten close I’ve gotten rid of, all except the cunning little spy known as the Phoenix Fox. She was at my brother’s party and now she’s in my head. I should kill her, I really should. She’s gotten too close and she knows it. She keeps toying with me, jumping in and out of the crossfire. She’s good at the game, but I’m better. The clock is ticking and I’m good at waiting. I know she’ll come to me, they always do. And when she does, I’ll take care of her too. Here little fox, come test my fire.

    Homicide Detective Jared Clemmings has been working with the Boise Police Department for six years at the top of his class. He grew up on the streets and has connections on nearly every corner. There's no other job he'd rather have and no other place he'd rather live.

    Reila Pru is tired of running around the country to escape her past ghosts, and Boise, Idaho looks like the perfect place to finally settle down and enjoy life. Unfortunately, ghosts always return to haunt you until they're put to rest, and she has some big and scary ones.
    
    Together, the two get tangled up in kidnappings, murders, and political scandals that all seem to be dangerously connected. Someone, somewhere, is using them to reveal secrets that have been laid down for years and are tangled in ways that affect the whole city, and maybe even the entire country. The keys to unlock and untangle all of them lie in Reila Pru's past and connections if she dares to face those ghosts and find them.

  title: Kidnapped and Afraid

    Do you know how to tell when you're about to be kidnapped? When someone who looks kinda off and acts kinda off is eyeing you for no apparent reason. There are a few basic rules to avoid being in this situation and becoming easy prey.

    First rule: be aware of your surroundings&mdash;the more aware you are the easier you can spot people watching you.

    Second rule: don't be out at night, alone, on dark streets&mdash;evil enjoys being in darkness, that's where fear can easily infiltrate your mind, and the less eyes around makes it even easier.

    Third rule: don't EVER panic&mdash;panicking clouds the mind and causes you to make dumb decisions. Instead, you need to think, pay attention, and be ready to act when the time is right. Try to recognize your kidnapper's habits and exploit them.

    I thought I had mastered these rules. After the first time, I thought that I couldn't be kidnapped ever again. I was wrong, very wrong. And when I got kidnapped the second time, I found out that those rules usually only work on mundane mortals, not immortal beings with enhanced abilities. Terrific.

    Guess its time to rewrite the rules... if I make it out, again.

  title: Dear Diary...

    All Sasha wanted to do was finish school, get a job she loved, get married, and start a family. Unfortunately, getting past school seems impossible. Between staying on track with her studies and keeping up with her other activities, graduation couldn’t be farther away. But then the Adlers show up.

    Caden Adler is… hot. That’s the only way Sasha can describe him without sounding like an idiot. He’s just the guy she should avoid, one that likes trouble. Avoiding him isn’t that hard, even though he watches her every day and makes her skin crawl. Yeah, avoiding Caden would be a great idea if she wanted to keep her virginity. Too bad Jennifer, Caden’s half-sister, has other plans.

    Jennifer Adler is that blond brat that everyone has met at least once and either befriends her immediately or loathes her forever. She wasn’t a problem until she decided she wanted to uncover all of Sasha’s past and reveal every little secret, and that’s ignoring the fact that she seems to want to hook Sasha up with Caden for God knows why.

    Sasha has a lot of secrets, and they’re kept that way for very good reasons. Those secrets can kill, and some people would kill for them. If Sasha doesn’t stop Jennifer, there’s going to be a war and the whole town might get destroyed in the crossfire.

  title: Court of Shadows and Fury

    Trust. Treachery. Deception.

    Nearly two millennia ago, the Shadow Court was formed, and what was then ruled by the Thunderbirds fell under the control of Vulas Farwynn. The Shadow Court, known for the most dangerous and deadly creatures, with guidance from the deadliest fae alive grew into a symbol of the fae's superiority and strength.

    Much of the Shadow Court's beginnings are shrouded in myths and suspicions, but it all began with one fae---Vulas Farwynn---and the annihilation of an entire race. When whispers of their return reach the Shadow Court, the High Lord tasks his son, the High Prince Faelynn Farwynn, with discovering the truth. This task could not have come at a better time, for the young prince has grown restless and is eager for a challenge. However, things change when the whispers are not only confirmed, but Faelynn comes face-to-face with the being; and she has a score to settle with the High Lord of the Shadow Court. And she will settle it, even if she has to kill the entire court.

    During the centuries, Azura has only longed for one thing---to avenge the death of her people and give them rest. Nearly one millennium ago, the fae came with talks of peace and friendship; but left with enough bloodshed to cover the planet. The massacre lasted three days. Azura could still remember the blood-soaked fields, the broken bodies, the screams of terror. For nearly a millennium, she carried those horrors in her mind, the only relief being that she would avenge it all. The fae unleashed a great evil that day, an evil that only her and her people themselves had known about. And Azura was the only one who could stop it... after, of course, she enacted a different type of evil over the Shadow Court.
