### Memos  
  
- [Sunday](./2024-11-03.md)  
	- Today is [Kieron](Kieron.md)’s birthday. I texted him, that’s pretty much it.  
- We went to Harvest Church and it was okay. The message was on slaying dragons with the Lord’s help.  
- Ended up FaceTimeing Kieron, and it was… okay, I guess. I don’t know, the spark isn’t there anymore. It hasn’t been for a while, but I’m really paying attention to it now. He just seems like an annoying older brother, and I really mean *annoying*. I enjoy talking to [Joshi](Joshua%20Alejandro.md) more.Embed from [2024-11-03](./2024-11-03.md)

- [Wednesday](./2024-11-06.md)  
	- I spoke to [Joshua](Joshua%20Alejandro.md) about how Mom kinda stole part of my cut of the Roth IRA that Grandma left me. He got pretty upset about it too, however, he was proud of me for being able to express my emotions about the whole thing.  
- I don’t know how he sees it, but he says that I’m stronger than I think I am and I’m not a coward. For some reason, I didn’t cry. Maybe, it’s because I knew Ms. Karen would arrive soon, I don’t know.Embed from [2024-11-06](./2024-11-06.md)

### Work Log  
  
- [Sunday](./2024-11-03.md)  
	- ([APO391](APO391.md)) I finished the discussion board for week 2  
- ([APO391](APO391.md)) I took the reading quiz, think I got every question right.  
- ([SOC2110](SOC2110.md)) Watched video 8, and it was… wow. The topic was abortion and it was a pretty good argument. The speaker showed a short video going over what a baby looks like after it’s aborted at different stages of growth. It was so sad. Even at the earliest stage, you can see the hands and fingers! How can someone see that and argue the fetus isn’t human?Embed from [2024-11-03](./2024-11-03.md)

- [Wednesday](./2024-11-06.md)  
	- Didn’t get much done, procrastinated for *hours* instead of reading [A New Introduction to Islam by Daniel W. Brown](Daniel%20W%20Brown%20-%20A%20New%20Introduction%20to%20Islam.md).  
- Plot twist, I don’t even have to read the book this week! All that’s due is Lecture 2 and an article comparing Christianity and Islam.Embed from [2024-11-06](./2024-11-06.md)
