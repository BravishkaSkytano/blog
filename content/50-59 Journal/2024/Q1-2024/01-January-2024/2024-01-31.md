The Trinity is not like an egg because the parts of an egg can be separated. A better analogy is a triangle.  
  
#### 09:19  
  
Do these verses prove that Jesus is God the Father as [Oneness Pentecostal](Oneness%20Pentecostal.md) believe?  
  
> 1 Corinthians 1:3  
> ![1 Cor 1 > 3](1%20Cor%201.md#3)  
  
> Romans 1:7  
> ![Rom 1 > 7](Rom%201.md#7)  
  
They argue that "and" (Greek: kai) in the phrase should be translated as even, making Jesus and the Father seem like one. It is true that *kai* can be translated as "even" but *kai* has a very limited semantic range.

Is water baptism a condition for salvation?  
  
> 1 Corinthians 1:17  
> ![ 1 Cor 1 > 17](1%20Cor%201.md#17)  
  
> Matthew 28:19  
> ![Matt 28 > 19](Matt%2028.md#19)  
  
Paul says Christ didn't send him to baptize people, yet Christ commission his disciples to baptize people. Therefore, is baptism required for salvation? Some groups, such as the [Mormons](Mormons.md), think so.  
  
 Paul wasn't opposed to baptism ([Acts 2 > 38](../../../../../Acts%202.md#38)), but he didn't believe it was a requirement for salvation. He believed it was a symbol of salvation.  
  
#### 09:36  
  
> 1 Corinthians 3:15  
> ![1 Cor 3 > 15](1%20Cor%203.md#15)  
  
Paul declares that people are saved only through fire. [Roman Catholic](Roman%20Catholic.md) scholars argue that "the Latin Fathers take the passage to mean a transient purification punishment in the other world." (Ott, 1960, 483)  
  
Here, Paul is speaking about *works,* not people. He is saying that we will have a "reward" in heaven.  
  
#### 09:40  
  
Was Paul's condemnation of homosexuality merely his own idea? Was he against all homosexual acts, or only offensive ones?  
  
> 1 Corinthians 6:9
