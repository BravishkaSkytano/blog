###### 1  
My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have struck hands in pledge with a stranger,  
  
###### 2  
if you have been trapped by the words of your lips, ensnared by the words of your mouth,  
  
###### 3  
then do this, my son, to free yourself, for you have fallen into your neighbor’s hands: Go, humble yourself, and press your plea with your neighbor.  
  
###### 4  
Allow no sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids.  
  
###### 5  
Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.  
  
###### 6  
Walk in the manner of the ant, O slacker; observe its ways and become wise.  
  
###### 7  
Without a commander, without an overseer or ruler,  
  
###### 8  
it prepares its provisions in summer; it gathers its food at harvest.  
  
###### 9  
How long will you lie there, O slacker? When will you get up from your sleep?  
  
###### 10  
A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,  
  
###### 11  
and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and need like a bandit.  
  
###### 12  
A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth,  
  
###### 13  
winking his eyes, speaking with his feet, and pointing with his fingers.  
  
###### 14  
With deceit in his heart he devises evil; he continually sows discord.  
  
###### 15  
Therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in an instant he will be shattered beyond recovery.  
  
###### 16  
There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to Him:  
  
###### 17  
haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,  
  
###### 18  
a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that run swiftly to evil,  
  
###### 19  
a false witness who gives false testimony, and one who stirs up discord among brothers.  
  
###### 20  
My son, keep your father’s commandment, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.  
  
###### 21  
Bind them always upon your heart; tie them around your neck.  
  
###### 22  
When you walk, they will guide you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you.  
  
###### 23  
For this commandment is a lamp, this teaching is a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way to life,  
  
###### 24  
to keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.  
  
###### 25  
Do not lust in your heart for her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes.  
  
###### 26  
For the levy of the prostitute is poverty, and the adulteress preys upon your very life.  
  
###### 27  
Can a man embrace fire and his clothes not be burned?  
  
###### 28  
Can a man walk on hot coals without scorching his feet?  
  
###### 29  
So is he who sleeps with another man’s wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.  
  
###### 30  
Men do not despise the thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger.  
  
###### 31  
Yet if caught, he must pay sevenfold; he must give up all the wealth of his house.  
  
###### 32  
He who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself.  
  
###### 33  
Wounds and dishonor will befall him, and his reproach will never be wiped away.  
  
###### 34  
For jealousy enrages a husband, and he will show no mercy in the day of vengeance.  
  
###### 35  
He will not be appeased by any ransom, or persuaded by lavish gifts.
