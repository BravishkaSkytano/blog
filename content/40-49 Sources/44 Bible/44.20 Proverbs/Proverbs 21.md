###### 1  
The king’s heart is a waterway in the hand of the LORD; He directs it where He pleases.  
  
###### 2  
All a man’s ways seem right to him, but the LORD weighs the heart.  
  
###### 3  
To do righteousness and justice is more desirable to the LORD than sacrifice.  
  
###### 4  
Haughty eyes and a proud heart—the guides of the wicked—are sin.  
  
###### 5  
The plans of the diligent bring plenty, as surely as haste leads to poverty.  
  
###### 6  
Making a fortune by a lying tongue is a vanishing mist, a deadly pursuit.  
  
###### 7  
The violence of the wicked will sweep them away because they refuse to do what is just.  
  
###### 8  
The way of a guilty man is crooked, but the conduct of the innocent is upright.  
  
###### 9  
Better to live on a corner of the roof than to share a house with a quarrelsome wife.  
  
###### 10  
The soul of the wicked man craves evil; his neighbor finds no favor in his eyes.  
  
###### 11  
When a mocker is punished, the simple gain wisdom; and when a wise man is instructed, he acquires knowledge.  
  
###### 12  
The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked and brings the wicked to ruin.  
  
###### 13  
Whoever shuts his ears to the cry of the poor, he too shall cry out and receive no answer.  
  
###### 14  
A gift in secret soothes anger, and a covert bribe pacifies great wrath.  
  
###### 15  
Justice executed is a joy to the righteous, but a terror to the workers of iniquity.  
  
###### 16  
The man who strays from the path of understanding will rest in the assembly of the dead.  
  
###### 17  
He who loves pleasure will become poor; the one who loves wine and oil will never be rich.  
  
###### 18  
The wicked become a ransom for the righteous, and the faithless for the upright.  
  
###### 19  
Better to live in the desert than with a contentious and ill-tempered wife.  
  
###### 20  
Precious treasures and oil are in the dwelling of the wise, but a foolish man consumes them.  
  
###### 21  
He who pursues righteousness and loving devotion finds life, righteousness, and honor.  
  
###### 22  
A wise man scales the city of the mighty and pulls down the stronghold in which they trust.  
  
###### 23  
He who guards his mouth and tongue keeps his soul from distress.  
  
###### 24  
Mocker is the name of the proud and arrogant man—of him who acts with excessive pride.  
  
###### 25  
The craving of the slacker kills him because his hands refuse to work.  
  
###### 26  
All day long he covets more, but the righteous give without restraint.  
  
###### 27  
The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable—how much more so when brought with ill intent!  
  
###### 28  
A lying witness will perish, but the man who listens to truth will speak forever.  
  
###### 29  
A wicked man hardens his face, but the upright man makes his way sure.  
  
###### 30  
There is no wisdom, no understanding, no counsel that can prevail against the LORD.  
  
###### 31  
A horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory is of the LORD.
