###### 1  
My son, keep my words and treasure my commandments within you.  
  
###### 2  
Keep my commandments and live; guard my teachings as the apple of your eye.  
  
###### 3  
Tie them to your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.  
  
###### 4  
Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and call understanding your kinsman,  
  
###### 5  
that they may keep you from the adulteress, from the stranger with seductive words.  
  
###### 6  
For at the window of my house I looked through the lattice.  
  
###### 7  
I saw among the simple, I noticed among the youths, a young man lacking judgment,  
  
###### 8  
crossing the street near her corner, strolling down the road to her house,  
  
###### 9  
at twilight, as the day was fading into the dark of the night.  
  
###### 10  
Then a woman came out to meet him, with the attire of a harlot and cunning of heart.  
  
###### 11  
She is loud and defiant; her feet do not remain at home.  
  
###### 12  
Now in the street, now in the squares, she lurks at every corner.  
  
###### 13  
She seizes him and kisses him; she brazenly says to him:  
  
###### 14  
“I have made my peace offerings; today I have paid my vows.  
  
###### 15  
So I came out to meet you; I sought you, and I have found you.  
  
###### 16  
I have decked my bed with coverings, with colored linen from Egypt.  
  
###### 17  
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, with aloes, and with cinnamon.  
  
###### 18  
Come, let us take our fill of love till morning. Let us delight in loving caresses!  
  
###### 19  
For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.  
  
###### 20  
He took with him a bag of money and will not return till the moon is full.”  
  
###### 21  
With her great persuasion she entices him; with her flattering lips she lures him.  
  
###### 22  
He follows her on impulse, like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer bounding into a trap,  
  
###### 23  
until an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare—not knowing it will cost him his life.  
  
###### 24  
Now, my sons, listen to me, and attend to the words of my mouth.  
  
###### 25  
Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths.  
  
###### 26  
For she has brought many down to death; her slain are many in number.  
  
###### 27  
Her house is the road to Sheol, descending to the chambers of death.
