###### 1  
A good name is more desirable than great riches; favor is better than silver and gold.  
  
###### 2  
The rich and the poor have this in common: The LORD is Maker of them all.  
  
###### 3  
The prudent see danger and take cover, but the simple keep going and suffer the consequences.  
  
###### 4  
The rewards of humility and the fear of the LORD are wealth and honor and life.  
  
###### 5  
Thorns and snares lie on the path of the perverse; he who guards his soul stays far from them.  
  
###### 6  
Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.  
  
###### 7  
The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is slave to the lender.  
  
###### 8  
He who sows injustice will reap disaster, and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.  
  
###### 9  
A generous man will be blessed, for he shares his bread with the poor.  
  
###### 10  
Drive out the mocker, and conflict will depart; even quarreling and insults will cease.  
  
###### 11  
He who loves a pure heart and gracious lips will have the king for a friend.  
  
###### 12  
The LORD’s eyes keep watch over knowledge, but He frustrates the words of the faithless.  
  
###### 13  
The slacker says, “There is a lion outside! I will be slain in the streets!”  
  
###### 14  
The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit; he who is under the wrath of the LORD will fall into it.  
  
###### 15  
Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline drives it far from him.  
  
###### 16  
Oppressing the poor to enrich oneself or giving gifts to the rich will surely lead to poverty.  
  
###### 17  
Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise—apply your mind to my knowledge—  
  
###### 18  
for it is pleasing when you keep them within you and they are constantly on your lips.  
  
###### 19  
So that your trust may be in the LORD, I instruct you today—yes, you.  
  
###### 20  
Have I not written for you thirty sayings about counsel and knowledge,  
  
###### 21  
to show you true and reliable words, that you may soundly answer those who sent you?  
  
###### 22  
Do not rob a poor man because he is poor, and do not crush the afflicted at the gate,  
  
###### 23  
for the LORD will take up their case and will plunder those who rob them.  
  
###### 24  
Do not make friends with an angry man, and do not associate with a hot-tempered man,  
  
###### 25  
or you may learn his ways and entangle yourself in a snare.  
  
###### 26  
Do not be one who gives pledges, who puts up security for debts.  
  
###### 27  
If you have nothing with which to pay, why should your bed be taken from under you?  
  
###### 28  
Do not move an ancient boundary stone which your fathers have placed.  
  
###### 29  
Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will be stationed in the presence of kings; he will not stand before obscure men.
