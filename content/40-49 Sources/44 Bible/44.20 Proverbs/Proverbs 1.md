###### 1  
These are the proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel,  
  
###### 2  
for gaining wisdom and discipline, for comprehending words of insight,  
  
###### 3  
and for receiving instruction in wise living and in righteousness, justice, and equity.  
  
###### 4  
To impart prudence to the simple and knowledge and discretion to the young,  
  
###### 5  
let the wise listen and gain instruction, and the discerning acquire wise counsel  
  
###### 6  
by understanding the proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise.  
  
###### 7  
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.  
  
###### 8  
Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction, and do not forsake the teaching of your mother.  
  
###### 9  
For they are a garland of grace on your head and a pendant around your neck.  
  
###### 10  
My son, if sinners entice you, do not yield to them.  
  
###### 11  
If they say, “Come along, let us lie in wait for blood, let us ambush the innocent without cause,  
  
###### 12  
let us swallow them alive like Sheol, and whole like those descending into the Pit.  
  
###### 13  
We will find all manner of precious goods; we will fill our houses with plunder.  
  
###### 14  
Throw in your lot with us; let us all share one purse”—  
  
###### 15  
my son, do not walk the road with them or set foot upon their path.  
  
###### 16  
For their feet run to evil, and they are swift to shed blood.  
  
###### 17  
How futile it is to spread the net where any bird can see it!  
  
###### 18  
But they lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush their own lives.  
  
###### 19  
Such is the fate of all who are greedy, whose unjust gain takes the lives of its possessors.  
  
###### 20  
Wisdom calls out in the street, she lifts her voice in the square;  
  
###### 21  
in the main concourse she cries aloud, at the city gates she makes her speech:  
  
###### 22  
“How long, O simple ones, will you love your simple ways? How long will scoffers delight in their scorn and fools hate knowledge?  
  
###### 23  
If you had repented at my rebuke, then surely I would have poured out my spirit on you; I would have made my words known to you.  
  
###### 24  
Because you refused my call, and no one took my outstretched hand,  
  
###### 25  
because you neglected all my counsel, and wanted none of my correction,  
  
###### 26  
in turn I will mock your calamity; I will sneer when terror strikes you,  
  
###### 27  
when your dread comes like a storm, and your destruction like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish overwhelm you.  
  
###### 28  
Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; they will earnestly seek me, but will not find me.  
  
###### 29  
For they hated knowledge and chose not to fear the LORD.  
  
###### 30  
They accepted none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof.  
  
###### 31  
So they will eat the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.  
  
###### 32  
For the waywardness of the simple will slay them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them.  
  
###### 33  
But whoever listens to me will dwell in safety, secure from the fear of evil.”
