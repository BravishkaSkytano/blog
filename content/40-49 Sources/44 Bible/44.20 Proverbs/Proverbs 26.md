###### 1  
Like snow in summer and rain at harvest, honor does not befit a fool.  
  
###### 2  
Like a fluttering sparrow or darting swallow, an undeserved curse does not come to rest.  
  
###### 3  
A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the backs of fools!  
  
###### 4  
Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you yourself will be like him.  
  
###### 5  
Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he become wise in his own eyes.  
  
###### 6  
Like cutting off one’s own feet or drinking violence is the sending of a message by the hand of a fool.  
  
###### 7  
Like lame legs hanging limp is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.  
  
###### 8  
Like binding a stone into a sling is the giving of honor to a fool.  
  
###### 9  
Like a thorn that falls into the hand of a drunkard is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.  
  
###### 10  
Like an archer who wounds at random is he who hires a fool or passerby.  
  
###### 11  
As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly.  
  
###### 12  
Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.  
  
###### 13  
The slacker says, “A lion is in the road! A fierce lion roams the public square!”  
  
###### 14  
As a door turns on its hinges, so the slacker turns on his bed.  
  
###### 15  
The slacker buries his hand in the dish; it wearies him to bring it back to his mouth.  
  
###### 16  
The slacker is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who answer discreetly.  
  
###### 17  
Like one who grabs a dog by the ears is a passerby who meddles in a quarrel not his own.  
  
###### 18  
Like a madman shooting firebrands and deadly arrows,  
  
###### 19  
so is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, “I was only joking!”  
  
###### 20  
Without wood, a fire goes out; without gossip, a conflict ceases.  
  
###### 21  
Like charcoal for embers and wood for fire, so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife.  
  
###### 22  
The words of a gossip are like choice morsels that go down into the inmost being.  
  
###### 23  
Like glaze covering an earthen vessel are burning lips and a wicked heart.  
  
###### 24  
A hateful man disguises himself with his speech, but he lays up deceit in his heart.  
  
###### 25  
When he speaks graciously, do not believe him, for seven abominations fill his heart.  
  
###### 26  
Though his hatred is concealed by deception, his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.  
  
###### 27  
He who digs a pit will fall into it, and he who rolls a stone will have it roll back on him.  
  
###### 28  
A lying tongue hates those it crushes, and a flattering mouth causes ruin.
