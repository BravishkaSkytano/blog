###### 1  
My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments;  
  
###### 2  
for they will add length to your days, years and peace to your life.  
  
###### 3  
Never let loving devotion or faithfulness leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.  
  
###### 4  
Then you will find favor and high regard in the sight of God and man.  
  
###### 5  
Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding;  
  
###### 6  
in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.  
  
###### 7  
Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and turn away from evil.  
  
###### 8  
This will bring healing to your body and refreshment to your bones.  
  
###### 9  
Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your harvest;  
  
###### 10  
then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine.  
  
###### 11  
My son, do not reject the discipline of the LORD, and do not loathe His rebuke;  
  
###### 12  
for the LORD disciplines the one He loves, as does a father the son in whom he delights.  
  
###### 13  
Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, the man who acquires understanding,  
  
###### 14  
for she is more profitable than silver, and her gain is better than fine gold.  
  
###### 15  
She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire compares with her.  
  
###### 16  
Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.  
  
###### 17  
All her ways are pleasant, and all her paths are peaceful.  
  
###### 18  
She is a tree of life to those who embrace her, and those who lay hold of her are blessed.  
  
###### 19  
The LORD founded the earth by wisdom and established the heavens by understanding.  
  
###### 20  
By His knowledge the watery depths were broken open, and the clouds dripped with dew.  
  
###### 21  
My son, do not lose sight of this: Preserve sound judgment and discernment.  
  
###### 22  
They will be life to your soul and adornment to your neck.  
  
###### 23  
Then you will go on your way in safety, and your foot will not stumble.  
  
###### 24  
When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you rest, your sleep will be sweet.  
  
###### 25  
Do not fear sudden danger or the ruin that overtakes the wicked,  
  
###### 26  
for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from the snare.  
  
###### 27  
Do not withhold good from the deserving when it is within your power to act.  
  
###### 28  
Do not tell your neighbor, “Come back tomorrow and I will provide”—when you already have the means.  
  
###### 29  
Do not devise evil against your neighbor, for he trustfully dwells beside you.  
  
###### 30  
Do not accuse a man without cause, when he has done you no harm.  
  
###### 31  
Do not envy a violent man or choose any of his ways;  
  
###### 32  
for the LORD detests the perverse, but He is a friend to the upright.  
  
###### 33  
The curse of the LORD is on the house of the wicked, but He blesses the home of the righteous.  
  
###### 34  
He mocks the mockers, but gives grace to the humble.  
  
###### 35  
The wise will inherit honor, but fools are held up to shame.
