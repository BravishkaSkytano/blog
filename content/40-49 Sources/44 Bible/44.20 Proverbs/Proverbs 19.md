###### 1  
Better a poor man who walks with integrity than a fool whose lips are perverse.  
  
###### 2  
Even zeal is no good without knowledge, and he who hurries his footsteps misses the mark.  
  
###### 3  
A man’s own folly subverts his way, yet his heart rages against the LORD.  
  
###### 4  
Wealth attracts many friends, but a poor man is deserted by his friend.  
  
###### 5  
A false witness will not go unpunished, and one who utters lies will not escape.  
  
###### 6  
Many seek the favor of the prince, and everyone is a friend of the gift giver.  
  
###### 7  
All the brothers of a poor man hate him—how much more do his friends avoid him! He may pursue them with pleading, but they are nowhere to be found.  
  
###### 8  
He who acquires wisdom loves himself; one who safeguards understanding will find success.  
  
###### 9  
A false witness will not go unpunished, and one who pours out lies will perish.  
  
###### 10  
Luxury is unseemly for a fool—how much worse for a slave to rule over princes!  
  
###### 11  
A man’s insight gives him patience, and his virtue is to overlook an offense.  
  
###### 12  
A king’s rage is like the roar of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass.  
  
###### 13  
A foolish son is his father’s ruin, and a quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping.  
  
###### 14  
Houses and wealth are inherited from fathers, but a prudent wife is from the LORD.  
  
###### 15  
Laziness brings on deep sleep, and an idle soul will suffer hunger.  
  
###### 16  
He who keeps a commandment preserves his soul, but he who is careless in his ways will die.  
  
###### 17  
Kindness to the poor is a loan to the LORD, and He will repay the lender.  
  
###### 18  
Discipline your son, for in that there is hope; do not be party to his death.  
  
###### 19  
A man of great anger must pay the penalty; if you rescue him, you will have to do so again.  
  
###### 20  
Listen to counsel and accept discipline, that you may be wise the rest of your days.  
  
###### 21  
Many plans are in a man’s heart, but the purpose of the LORD will prevail.  
  
###### 22  
The desire of a man is loving devotion; better to be poor than a liar.  
  
###### 23  
The fear of the LORD leads to life, that one may rest content, without visitation from harm.  
  
###### 24  
The slacker buries his hand in the dish; he will not even bring it back to his mouth.  
  
###### 25  
Strike a mocker, and the simple will beware; rebuke the discerning man, and he will gain knowledge.  
  
###### 26  
He who assaults his father or evicts his mother is a son who brings shame and disgrace.  
  
###### 27  
If you cease to hear instruction, my son, you will stray from the words of knowledge.  
  
###### 28  
A corrupt witness mocks justice, and a wicked mouth swallows iniquity.  
  
###### 29  
Judgments are prepared for mockers, and beatings for the backs of fools.
