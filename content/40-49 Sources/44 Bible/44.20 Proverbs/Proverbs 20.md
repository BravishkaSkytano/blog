###### 1  
Wine is a mocker, strong drink is a brawler, and whoever is led astray by them is not wise.  
  
###### 2  
The terror of a king is like the roar of a lion; whoever provokes him forfeits his own life.  
  
###### 3  
It is honorable for a man to resolve a dispute, but any fool will quarrel.  
  
###### 4  
The slacker does not plow in season; at harvest time he looks, but nothing is there.  
  
###### 5  
The intentions of a man’s heart are deep waters, but a man of understanding draws them out.  
  
###### 6  
Many a man proclaims his loving devotion, but who can find a trustworthy man?  
  
###### 7  
The righteous man walks with integrity; blessed are his children after him.  
  
###### 8  
A king who sits on a throne to judge sifts out all evil with his eyes.  
  
###### 9  
Who can say, “I have kept my heart pure; I am cleansed from my sin”?  
  
###### 10  
Differing weights and unequal measures—both are detestable to the LORD.  
  
###### 11  
Even a young man is known by his actions—whether his conduct is pure and upright.  
  
###### 12  
Ears that hear and eyes that see—the LORD has made them both.  
  
###### 13  
Do not love sleep, or you will grow poor; open your eyes, and you will have plenty of food.  
  
###### 14  
“Worthless, worthless!” says the buyer, but on the way out, he gloats.  
  
###### 15  
There is an abundance of gold and rubies, but lips of knowledge are a rare treasure.  
  
###### 16  
Take the garment of the one who posts security for a stranger; get collateral if it is for a foreigner.  
  
###### 17  
Food gained by fraud is sweet to a man, but later his mouth is full of gravel.  
  
###### 18  
Set plans by consultation, and wage war under sound guidance.  
  
###### 19  
He who reveals secrets is a constant gossip; avoid the one who babbles with his lips.  
  
###### 20  
Whoever curses his father or mother, his lamp will be extinguished in deepest darkness.  
  
###### 21  
An inheritance gained quickly will not be blessed in the end.  
  
###### 22  
Do not say, “I will avenge this evil!” Wait on the LORD, and He will save you.  
  
###### 23  
Unequal weights are detestable to the LORD, and dishonest scales are no good.  
  
###### 24  
A man’s steps are from the LORD, so how can anyone understand his own way?  
  
###### 25  
It is a trap for a man to dedicate something rashly, only later to reconsider his vows.  
  
###### 26  
A wise king separates out the wicked and drives the threshing wheel over them.  
  
###### 27  
The spirit of a man is the lamp of the LORD, searching out his inmost being.  
  
###### 28  
Loving devotion and faithfulness preserve a king; by these he maintains his throne.  
  
###### 29  
The glory of young men is their strength, and gray hair is the splendor of the old.  
  
###### 30  
Lashes and wounds scour evil, and beatings cleanse the inmost parts.
