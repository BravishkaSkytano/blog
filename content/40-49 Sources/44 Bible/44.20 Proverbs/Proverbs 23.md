###### 1  
When you sit down to dine with a ruler, consider carefully what is set before you,  
  
###### 2  
and put a knife to your throat if you possess a great appetite.  
  
###### 3  
Do not crave his delicacies, for that food is deceptive.  
  
###### 4  
Do not wear yourself out to get rich; be wise enough to restrain yourself.  
  
###### 5  
When you glance at wealth, it disappears, for it makes wings for itself and flies like an eagle to the sky.  
  
###### 6  
Do not eat the bread of a stingy man, and do not crave his delicacies;  
  
###### 7  
for he is keeping track, inwardly counting the cost. “Eat and drink,” he says to you, but his heart is not with you.  
  
###### 8  
You will vomit up what little you have eaten and waste your pleasant words.  
  
###### 9  
Do not speak to a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words.  
  
###### 10  
Do not move an ancient boundary stone or encroach on the fields of the fatherless,  
  
###### 11  
for their Redeemer is strong; He will take up their case against you.  
  
###### 12  
Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge.  
  
###### 13  
Do not withhold discipline from a child; although you strike him with a rod, he will not die.  
  
###### 14  
Strike him with a rod, and you will deliver his soul from Sheol.  
  
###### 15  
My son, if your heart is wise, my own heart will indeed rejoice.  
  
###### 16  
My inmost being will rejoice when your lips speak what is right.  
  
###### 17  
Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always continue in the fear of the LORD.  
  
###### 18  
For surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.  
  
###### 19  
Listen, my son, and be wise, and guide your heart on the right course.  
  
###### 20  
Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat.  
  
###### 21  
For the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe them in rags.  
  
###### 22  
Listen to your father who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old.  
  
###### 23  
Invest in truth and never sell it—in wisdom and instruction and understanding.  
  
###### 24  
The father of a righteous man will greatly rejoice, and he who fathers a wise son will delight in him.  
  
###### 25  
May your father and mother be glad, and may she who gave you birth rejoice!  
  
###### 26  
My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes delight in my ways.  
  
###### 27  
For a prostitute is a deep pit, and an adulteress is a narrow well.  
  
###### 28  
Like a robber she lies in wait and multiplies the faithless among men.  
  
###### 29  
Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaints? Who has needless wounds? Who has bloodshot eyes?  
  
###### 30  
Those who linger over wine, who go to taste mixed drinks.  
  
###### 31  
Do not gaze at wine while it is red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly.  
  
###### 32  
In the end it bites like a snake and stings like a viper.  
  
###### 33  
Your eyes will see strange things, and your mind will utter perversities.  
  
###### 34  
You will be like one sleeping on the high seas or lying on the top of a mast:  
  
###### 35  
“They struck me, but I feel no pain! They beat me, but I did not know it! When can I wake up to search for another drink?”
