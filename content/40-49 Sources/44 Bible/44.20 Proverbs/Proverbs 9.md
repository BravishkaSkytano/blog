###### 1  
Wisdom has built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars.  
  
###### 2  
She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine; she has also set her table.  
  
###### 3  
She has sent out her maidservants; she calls out from the heights of the city.  
  
###### 4  
“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” she says to him who lacks judgment.  
  
###### 5  
“Come, eat my bread and drink the wine I have mixed.  
  
###### 6  
Leave your folly behind, and you will live; walk in the way of understanding.”  
  
###### 7  
He who corrects a mocker brings shame on himself; he who rebukes a wicked man taints himself.  
  
###### 8  
Do not rebuke a mocker, or he will hate you; rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.  
  
###### 9  
Instruct a wise man, and he will be wiser still; teach a righteous man, and he will increase his learning.  
  
###### 10  
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.  
  
###### 11  
For through wisdom your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life.  
  
###### 12  
If you are wise, you are wise to your own advantage; but if you scoff, you alone will bear the consequences.  
  
###### 13  
The woman named Folly is loud; she is naive and knows nothing.  
  
###### 14  
She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the heights of the city,  
  
###### 15  
calling out to those who pass by, who make their paths straight.  
  
###### 16  
“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” she says to him who lacks judgment.  
  
###### 17  
“Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is tasty!”  
  
###### 18  
But they do not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
