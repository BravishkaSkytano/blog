###### 1  
These are the words of King Lemuel—the burden that his mother taught him:  
  
###### 2  
What shall I say, O my son? What, O son of my womb? What, O son of my vows?  
  
###### 3  
Do not spend your strength on women or your vigor on those who ruin kings.  
  
###### 4  
It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to crave strong drink,  
  
###### 5  
lest they drink and forget what is decreed, depriving all the oppressed of justice.  
  
###### 6  
Give strong drink to one who is perishing, and wine to the bitter in soul.  
  
###### 7  
Let him drink and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.  
  
###### 8  
Open your mouth for those with no voice, for the cause of all the dispossessed.  
  
###### 9  
Open your mouth, judge righteously, and defend the cause of the poor and needy.  
  
###### 10  
A wife of noble character, who can find? She is far more precious than rubies.  
  
###### 11  
The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he lacks nothing of value.  
  
###### 12  
She brings him good and not harm all the days of her life.  
  
###### 13  
She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands.  
  
###### 14  
She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar.  
  
###### 15  
She rises while it is still night to provide food for her household and portions for her maidservants.  
  
###### 16  
She appraises a field and buys it; from her earnings she plants a vineyard.  
  
###### 17  
She girds herself with strength and shows that her arms are strong.  
  
###### 18  
She sees that her gain is good, and her lamp is not extinguished at night.  
  
###### 19  
She stretches out her hands to the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers.  
  
###### 20  
She opens her arms to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy.  
  
###### 21  
When it snows, she has no fear for her household, for they are all clothed in scarlet.  
  
###### 22  
She makes coverings for her bed; her clothing is fine linen and purple.  
  
###### 23  
Her husband is known at the city gate, where he sits among the elders of the land.  
  
###### 24  
She makes linen garments and sells them; she delivers sashes to the merchants.  
  
###### 25  
Strength and honor are her clothing, and she can laugh at the days to come.  
  
###### 26  
She opens her mouth with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue.  
  
###### 27  
She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.  
  
###### 28  
Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband praises her as well:  
  
###### 29  
“Many daughters have done noble things, but you surpass them all!”  
  
###### 30  
Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.  
  
###### 31  
Give her the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her at the gates.
