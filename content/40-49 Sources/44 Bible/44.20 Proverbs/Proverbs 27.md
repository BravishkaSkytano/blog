###### 1  
Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.  
  
###### 2  
Let another praise you, and not your own mouth—a stranger, and not your own lips.  
  
###### 3  
A stone is heavy and sand is a burden, but aggravation from a fool outweighs them both.  
  
###### 4  
Wrath is cruel and anger is like a flood, but who can withstand jealousy?  
  
###### 5  
Better an open rebuke than love that is concealed.  
  
###### 6  
The wounds of a friend are faithful, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.  
  
###### 7  
The soul that is full loathes honey, but to a hungry soul, any bitter thing is sweet.  
  
###### 8  
Like a bird that strays from its nest is a man who wanders from his home.  
  
###### 9  
Oil and incense bring joy to the heart, and the sweetness of a friend is counsel to the soul.  
  
###### 10  
Do not forsake your friend or your father’s friend, and do not go to your brother’s house in the day of your calamity; better a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.  
  
###### 11  
Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart, so that I can answer him who taunts me.  
  
###### 12  
The prudent see danger and take cover; but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.  
  
###### 13  
Take the garment of him who posts security for a stranger; get collateral if it is for a foreigner.  
  
###### 14  
If one blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, it will be counted to him as a curse.  
  
###### 15  
A constant dripping on a rainy day and a contentious woman are alike—  
  
###### 16  
restraining her is like holding back the wind or grasping oil with one’s right hand.  
  
###### 17  
As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.  
  
###### 18  
Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and he who looks after his master will be honored.  
  
###### 19  
As water reflects the face, so the heart reflects the true man.  
  
###### 20  
Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.  
  
###### 21  
A crucible for silver and a furnace for gold, but a man is tested by the praise accorded him.  
  
###### 22  
Though you grind a fool like grain with mortar and a pestle, yet his folly will not depart from him.  
  
###### 23  
Be sure to know the state of your flocks, and pay close attention to your herds;  
  
###### 24  
for riches are not forever, nor does a crown endure to every generation.  
  
###### 25  
When hay is removed and new growth appears and the grain from the hills is gathered,  
  
###### 26  
the lambs will provide you with clothing, and the goats with the price of a field.  
  
###### 27  
You will have plenty of goats’ milk to feed you—food for your household and nourishment for your maidservants.
