###### 1  
Do not envy wicked men or desire their company;  
  
###### 2  
for their hearts devise violence, and their lips declare trouble.  
  
###### 3  
By wisdom a house is built and by understanding it is established;  
  
###### 4  
through knowledge its rooms are filled with every precious and beautiful treasure.  
  
###### 5  
A wise man is strong, and a man of knowledge enhances his strength.  
  
###### 6  
Only with sound guidance should you wage war, and victory lies in a multitude of counselors.  
  
###### 7  
Wisdom is too high for a fool; he does not open his mouth in the meeting place.  
  
###### 8  
He who plots evil will be called a schemer.  
  
###### 9  
A foolish scheme is sin, and a mocker is detestable to men.  
  
###### 10  
If you faint in the day of distress, how small is your strength!  
  
###### 11  
Rescue those being led away to death, and restrain those stumbling toward the slaughter.  
  
###### 12  
If you say, “Behold, we did not know about this,” does not He who weighs hearts consider it? Does not the One who guards your life know? Will He not repay a man according to his deeds?  
  
###### 13  
Eat honey, my son, for it is good, and the honeycomb is sweet to your taste.  
  
###### 14  
Know therefore that wisdom is sweet to your soul. If you find it, there is a future for you, and your hope will never be cut off.  
  
###### 15  
Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, near the dwelling of the righteous; do not destroy his resting place.  
  
###### 16  
For though a righteous man may fall seven times, he still gets up; but the wicked stumble in bad times.  
  
###### 17  
Do not gloat when your enemy falls, and do not let your heart rejoice when he stumbles,  
  
###### 18  
or the LORD will see and disapprove, and turn His wrath away from him.  
  
###### 19  
Do not fret over evildoers, and do not be envious of the wicked.  
  
###### 20  
For the evil man has no future; the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished.  
  
###### 21  
My son, fear the LORD and the king, and do not associate with the rebellious.  
  
###### 22  
For they will bring sudden destruction. Who knows what ruin they can bring?  
  
###### 23  
These also are sayings of the wise: To show partiality in judgment is not good.  
  
###### 24  
Whoever tells the guilty, “You are innocent”—peoples will curse him, and nations will denounce him;  
  
###### 25  
but it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and rich blessing will come upon them.  
  
###### 26  
An honest answer given is like a kiss on the lips.  
  
###### 27  
Complete your outdoor work and prepare your field; after that, you may build your house.  
  
###### 28  
Do not testify against your neighbor without cause, and do not deceive with your lips.  
  
###### 29  
Do not say, “I will do to him as he has done to me; I will repay the man according to his work.”  
  
###### 30  
I went past the field of a slacker and by the vineyard of a man lacking judgment.  
  
###### 31  
Thorns had grown up everywhere, thistles had covered the ground, and the stone wall was broken down.  
  
###### 32  
I observed and took it to heart; I looked and received instruction:  
  
###### 33  
A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,  
  
###### 34  
and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and need like a bandit.
