###### 1  
Does not wisdom call out, and understanding raise her voice?  
  
###### 2  
On the heights overlooking the road, at the crossroads she takes her stand.  
  
###### 3  
Beside the gates to the city, at the entrances she cries out:  
  
###### 4  
“To you, O men, I call out, and my cry is to the sons of men.  
  
###### 5  
O simple ones, learn to be shrewd; O fools, gain understanding.  
  
###### 6  
Listen, for I speak of noble things, and the opening of my lips will reveal right.  
  
###### 7  
For my mouth will speak the truth, and wickedness is detestable to my lips.  
  
###### 8  
All the words of my mouth are righteous; none are crooked or perverse.  
  
###### 9  
They are all plain to the discerning, and upright to those who find knowledge.  
  
###### 10  
Receive my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than pure gold.  
  
###### 11  
For wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire compares with her.  
  
###### 12  
I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.  
  
###### 13  
To fear the LORD is to hate evil; I hate arrogant pride, evil conduct, and perverse speech.  
  
###### 14  
Counsel and sound judgment are mine; I have insight and strength.  
  
###### 15  
By me kings reign, and rulers enact just laws;  
  
###### 16  
By me princes rule, and all nobles who govern justly.  
  
###### 17  
I love those who love me, and those who seek me early shall find me.  
  
###### 18  
With me are riches and honor, enduring wealth and righteousness.  
  
###### 19  
My fruit is better than gold, pure gold, and my harvest surpasses choice silver.  
  
###### 20  
I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,  
  
###### 21  
bestowing wealth on those who love me and making their treasuries full.  
  
###### 22  
The LORD created me as His first course, before His works of old.  
  
###### 23  
From everlasting I was established, from the beginning, before the earth began.  
  
###### 24  
When there were no watery depths, I was brought forth, when no springs were overflowing with water.  
  
###### 25  
Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was brought forth,  
  
###### 26  
before He made the land or fields, or any of the dust of the earth.  
  
###### 27  
I was there when He established the heavens, when He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep,  
  
###### 28  
when He established the clouds above, when the fountains of the deep gushed forth,  
  
###### 29  
when He set a boundary for the sea, so that the waters would not surpass His command, when He marked out the foundations of the earth.  
  
###### 30  
Then I was a skilled craftsman at His side, and His delight day by day, rejoicing always in His presence.  
  
###### 31  
I was rejoicing in His whole world, delighting together in the sons of men.  
  
###### 32  
Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, for blessed are those who keep my ways.  
  
###### 33  
Listen to instruction and be wise; do not ignore it.  
  
###### 34  
Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at the posts of my doorway.  
  
###### 35  
For whoever finds me finds life and obtains the favor of the LORD.  
  
###### 36  
But he who fails to find me harms himself; all who hate me love death.”
