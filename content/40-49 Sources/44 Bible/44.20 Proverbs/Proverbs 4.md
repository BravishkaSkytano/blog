###### 1  
Listen, my sons, to a father’s instruction; pay attention and gain understanding.  
  
###### 2  
For I give you sound teaching; do not abandon my directive.  
  
###### 3  
When I was a son to my father, tender and the only child of my mother,  
  
###### 4  
he taught me and said, “Let your heart lay hold of my words; keep my commands and you will live.  
  
###### 5  
Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or turn from them.  
  
###### 6  
Do not forsake wisdom, and she will preserve you; love her, and she will guard you.  
  
###### 7  
Wisdom is supreme; so acquire wisdom. And whatever you may acquire, gain understanding.  
  
###### 8  
Prize her, and she will exalt you; if you embrace her, she will honor you.  
  
###### 9  
She will set a garland of grace on your head; she will present you with a crown of beauty.”  
  
###### 10  
Listen, my son, and receive my words, and the years of your life will be many.  
  
###### 11  
I will guide you in the way of wisdom; I will lead you on straight paths.  
  
###### 12  
When you walk, your steps will not be impeded; when you run, you will not stumble.  
  
###### 13  
Hold on to instruction; do not let go. Guard it, for it is your life.  
  
###### 14  
Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evildoers.  
  
###### 15  
Avoid it; do not travel on it. Turn from it and pass on by.  
  
###### 16  
For they cannot sleep unless they do evil; they are deprived of slumber until they make someone fall.  
  
###### 17  
For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.  
  
###### 18  
The path of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn, shining brighter and brighter until midday.  
  
###### 19  
But the way of the wicked is like the darkest gloom; they do not know what makes them stumble.  
  
###### 20  
My son, pay attention to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.  
  
###### 21  
Do not lose sight of them; keep them within your heart.  
  
###### 22  
For they are life to those who find them, and health to the whole body.  
  
###### 23  
Guard your heart with all diligence, for from it flow springs of life.  
  
###### 24  
Put away deception from your mouth; keep your lips from perverse speech.  
  
###### 25  
Let your eyes look forward; fix your gaze straight ahead.  
  
###### 26  
Make a level path for your feet, and all your ways will be sure.  
  
###### 27  
Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your feet away from evil.
