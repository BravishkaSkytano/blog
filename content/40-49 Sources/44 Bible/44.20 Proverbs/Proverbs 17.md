###### 1  
Better a dry morsel in quietness than a house full of feasting with strife.  
  
###### 2  
A wise servant will rule over a disgraceful son and share his inheritance as one of the brothers.  
  
###### 3  
A crucible for silver and a furnace for gold, but the LORD is the tester of hearts.  
  
###### 4  
A wicked man listens to evil lips; a liar gives ear to a destructive tongue.  
  
###### 5  
He who mocks the poor insults their Maker; whoever gloats over calamity will not go unpunished.  
  
###### 6  
Grandchildren are the crown of the aged, and the glory of a son is his father.  
  
###### 7  
Eloquent words are unfit for a fool; how much worse are lying lips to a ruler!  
  
###### 8  
A bribe is a charm to its giver; wherever he turns, he succeeds.  
  
###### 9  
Whoever conceals an offense promotes love, but he who brings it up separates friends.  
  
###### 10  
A rebuke cuts into a man of discernment deeper than a hundred lashes cut into a fool.  
  
###### 11  
An evil man seeks only rebellion; a cruel messenger will be sent against him.  
  
###### 12  
It is better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than a fool in his folly.  
  
###### 13  
If anyone returns evil for good, evil will never leave his house.  
  
###### 14  
To start a quarrel is to release a flood; so abandon the dispute before it breaks out.  
  
###### 15  
Acquitting the guilty and condemning the righteous—both are detestable to the LORD.  
  
###### 16  
Why should the fool have money in his hand with no intention of buying wisdom?  
  
###### 17  
A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.  
  
###### 18  
A man lacking judgment strikes hands in pledge and puts up security for his neighbor.  
  
###### 19  
He who loves transgression loves strife; he who builds his gate high invites destruction.  
  
###### 20  
The one with a perverse heart finds no good, and he whose tongue is deceitful falls into trouble.  
  
###### 21  
A man fathers a fool to his own grief; the father of a fool has no joy.  
  
###### 22  
A joyful heart is good medicine, but a broken spirit dries up the bones.  
  
###### 23  
A wicked man takes a covert bribe to subvert the course of justice.  
  
###### 24  
Wisdom is the focus of the discerning, but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth.  
  
###### 25  
A foolish son brings grief to his father and bitterness to her who bore him.  
  
###### 26  
It is surely not good to punish the innocent or to flog a noble for his honesty.  
  
###### 27  
A man of knowledge restrains his words, and a man of understanding maintains a calm spirit.  
  
###### 28  
Even a fool is considered wise if he keeps silent, and discerning when he holds his tongue.
