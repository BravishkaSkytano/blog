From the fruit of his mouth a man’s belly is filled; with the harvest from his lips he is satisfied.  
  
###### 21  
Life and death are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit.

He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the LORD.  
  
###### 23  
The poor man pleads for mercy, but the rich man answers harshly.
