###### 1  
My son, if you accept my words and hide my commandments within you,  
  
###### 2  
if you incline your ear to wisdom and direct your heart to understanding,  
  
###### 3  
if you truly call out to insight and lift your voice to understanding,  
  
###### 4  
if you seek it like silver and search it out like hidden treasure,  
  
###### 5  
then you will discern the fear of the LORD and discover the knowledge of God.  
  
###### 6  
For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.  
  
###### 7  
He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk with integrity,  
  
###### 8  
to guard the paths of justice and protect the way of His saints.  
  
###### 9  
Then you will discern righteousness and justice and equity—every good path.  
  
###### 10  
For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will delight your soul.  
  
###### 11  
Discretion will watch over you, and understanding will guard you,  
  
###### 12  
to deliver you from the way of evil, from the man who speaks perversity,  
  
###### 13  
from those who leave the straight paths to walk in the ways of darkness,  
  
###### 14  
from those who enjoy doing evil and rejoice in the twistedness of evil,  
  
###### 15  
whose paths are crooked and whose ways are devious.  
  
###### 16  
It will rescue you from the forbidden woman, from the stranger with seductive words  
  
###### 17  
who abandons the partner of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God.  
  
###### 18  
For her house sinks down to death, and her tracks to the departed spirits.  
  
###### 19  
None who go to her return or negotiate the paths of life.  
  
###### 20  
So you will follow in the ways of the good, and keep to the paths of the righteous.  
  
###### 21  
For the upright will inhabit the land, and the blameless will remain in it;  
  
###### 22  
but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be uprooted.
