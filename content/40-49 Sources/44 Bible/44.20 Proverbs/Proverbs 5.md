###### 1  
My son, pay attention to my wisdom; incline your ear to my insight,  
  
###### 2  
that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge.  
  
###### 3  
Though the lips of the forbidden woman drip honey and her speech is smoother than oil,  
  
###### 4  
in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a double-edged sword.  
  
###### 5  
Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to Sheol.  
  
###### 6  
She does not consider the path of life; she does not know that her ways are unstable.  
  
###### 7  
So now, my sons, listen to me, and do not turn aside from the words of my mouth.  
  
###### 8  
Keep your path far from her; do not go near the door of her house,  
  
###### 9  
lest you concede your vigor to others, and your years to one who is cruel;  
  
###### 10  
lest strangers feast on your wealth, and your labors enrich the house of a foreigner.  
  
###### 11  
At the end of your life you will groan when your flesh and your body are spent,  
  
###### 12  
and you will say, “How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!  
  
###### 13  
I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my mentors.  
  
###### 14  
I am on the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the whole assembly.”  
  
###### 15  
Drink water from your own cistern, and running water from your own well.  
  
###### 16  
Why should your springs flow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?  
  
###### 17  
Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.  
  
###### 18  
May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth:  
  
###### 19  
A loving doe, a graceful fawn—may her breasts satisfy you always; may you be captivated by her love forever.  
  
###### 20  
Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress, or embrace the bosom of a stranger?  
  
###### 21  
For a man’s ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and the LORD examines all his paths.  
  
###### 22  
The iniquities of a wicked man entrap him; the cords of his sin entangle him.  
  
###### 23  
He dies for lack of discipline, led astray by his own great folly.
