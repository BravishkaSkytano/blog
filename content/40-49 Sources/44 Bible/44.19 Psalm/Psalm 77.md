###### 1  
For the choirmaster. According to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. I cried out to God; I cried aloud to God to hear me.  
  
###### 2  
In the day of trouble I sought the Lord; through the night my outstretched hands did not grow weary; my soul refused to be comforted.  
  
###### 3  
I remembered You, O God, and I groaned; I mused and my spirit grew faint. Selah  
  
###### 4  
You have kept my eyes from closing; I am too troubled to speak.  
  
###### 5  
I considered the days of old, the years long in the past.  
  
###### 6  
At night I remembered my song; in my heart I mused, and my spirit pondered:  
  
###### 7  
“Will the Lord spurn us forever and never show His favor again?  
  
###### 8  
Is His loving devotion gone forever? Has His promise failed for all time?  
  
###### 9  
Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has His anger shut off His compassion?” Selah  
  
###### 10  
So I said, “I am grieved that the right hand of the Most High has changed.”  
  
###### 11  
I will remember the works of the LORD; yes, I will remember Your wonders of old.  
  
###### 12  
I will reflect on all You have done and ponder Your mighty deeds.  
  
###### 13  
Your way, O God, is holy. What god is so great as our God?  
  
###### 14  
You are the God who works wonders; You display Your strength among the peoples.  
  
###### 15  
With power You redeemed Your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah  
  
###### 16  
The waters saw You, O God; the waters saw You and swirled; even the depths were shaken.  
  
###### 17  
The clouds poured down water; the skies resounded with thunder; Your arrows flashed back and forth.  
  
###### 18  
Your thunder resounded in the whirlwind; the lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked.  
  
###### 19  
Your path led through the sea, Your way through the mighty waters, but Your footprints were not to be found.  
  
###### 20  
You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
