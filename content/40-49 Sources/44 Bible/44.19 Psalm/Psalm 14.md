###### 1  
For the choirmaster. Of David. The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt; their acts are vile. There is no one who does good.  
  
###### 2  
The LORD looks down from heaven upon the sons of men to see if any understand, if any seek God.  
  
###### 3  
All have turned away, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.  
  
###### 4  
Will the workers of iniquity never learn? They devour my people like bread; they refuse to call upon the LORD.  
  
###### 5  
There they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is in the company of the righteous.  
  
###### 6  
You sinners frustrate the plans of the oppressed, yet the LORD is their shelter.  
  
###### 7  
Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion! When the LORD restores His captive people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad!
