###### 1  
For the choirmaster. Of David. To bring remembrance. Make haste, O God, to deliver me! Hurry, O LORD, to help me!  
  
###### 2  
May those who seek my life be ashamed and confounded; may those who wish me harm be repelled and humiliated.  
  
###### 3  
May those who say, “Aha, aha!” retreat because of their shame.  
  
###### 4  
May all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; may those who love Your salvation always say, “Let God be magnified!”  
  
###### 5  
But I am poor and needy; hurry to me, O God. You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay.
