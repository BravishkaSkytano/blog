###### 1  
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of His hands.  
  
###### 2  
Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge.  
  
###### 3  
Without speech or language, without a sound to be heard,  
  
###### 4  
their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens He has pitched a tent for the sun.  
  
###### 5  
Like a bridegroom emerging from his chamber, like a champion rejoicing to run his course,  
  
###### 6  
it rises at one end of the heavens and runs its circuit to the other; nothing is deprived of its warmth.  
  
###### 7  
The Law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy, making wise the simple.  
  
###### 8  
The precepts of the LORD are right, bringing joy to the heart; the commandments of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes.  
  
###### 9  
The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever; the judgments of the LORD are true, being altogether righteous.  
  
###### 10  
They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb.  
  
###### 11  
By them indeed Your servant is warned; in keeping them is great reward.  
  
###### 12  
Who can discern his own errors? Cleanse me from my hidden faults.  
  
###### 13  
Keep Your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then I will be blameless and cleansed of great transgression.  
  
###### 14  
May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in Your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.
