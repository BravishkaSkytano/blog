###### 1  
Of David. Blessed be the LORD, my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.  
  
###### 2  
He is my steadfast love and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer. He is my shield, in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples under me.  
  
###### 3  
O LORD, what is man, that You regard him, the son of man that You think of him?  
  
###### 4  
Man is like a breath; his days are like a passing shadow.  
  
###### 5  
Part Your heavens, O LORD, and come down; touch the mountains, that they may smoke.  
  
###### 6  
Flash forth Your lightning and scatter them; shoot Your arrows and rout them.  
  
###### 7  
Reach down from on high; set me free and rescue me from the deep waters, from the grasp of foreigners,  
  
###### 8  
whose mouths speak falsehood, whose right hands are deceitful.  
  
###### 9  
I will sing to You a new song, O God; on a harp of ten strings I will make music to You—  
  
###### 10  
to Him who gives victory to kings, who frees His servant David from the deadly sword.  
  
###### 11  
Set me free and rescue me from the grasp of foreigners, whose mouths speak falsehood, whose right hands are deceitful.  
  
###### 12  
Then our sons will be like plants nurtured in their youth, our daughters like corner pillars carved to adorn a palace.  
  
###### 13  
Our storehouses will be full, supplying all manner of produce; our flocks will bring forth thousands, tens of thousands in our fields.  
  
###### 14  
Our oxen will bear great loads. There will be no breach in the walls, no going into captivity, and no cry of lament in our streets.  
  
###### 15  
Blessed are the people of whom this is so; blessed are the people whose God is the LORD.
