###### 1  
Of David. To You, O LORD, I lift up my soul;  
  
###### 2  
in You, my God, I trust. Do not let me be put to shame; do not let my enemies exult over me.  
  
###### 3  
Surely none who wait for You will be put to shame; but those who are faithless without cause will be disgraced.  
  
###### 4  
Show me Your ways, O LORD; teach me Your paths.  
  
###### 5  
Guide me in Your truth and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation; all day long I wait for You.  
  
###### 6  
Remember, O LORD, Your compassion and loving devotion, for they are from age to age.  
  
###### 7  
Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my rebellious acts; remember me according to Your loving devotion, because of Your goodness, O LORD.  
  
###### 8  
Good and upright is the LORD; therefore He shows sinners the way.  
  
###### 9  
He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them His way.  
  
###### 10  
All the LORD’s ways are loving and faithful to those who keep His covenant and His decrees.  
  
###### 11  
For the sake of Your name, O LORD, forgive my iniquity, for it is great.  
  
###### 12  
Who is the man who fears the LORD? He will instruct him in the path chosen for him.  
  
###### 13  
His soul will dwell in prosperity, and his descendants will inherit the land.  
  
###### 14  
The LORD confides in those who fear Him, and reveals His covenant to them.  
  
###### 15  
My eyes are always on the LORD, for He will free my feet from the mesh.  
  
###### 16  
Turn to me and be gracious, for I am lonely and afflicted.  
  
###### 17  
The troubles of my heart increase; free me from my distress.  
  
###### 18  
Consider my affliction and trouble, and take away all my sins.  
  
###### 19  
Consider my enemies, for they are many, and they hate me with vicious hatred.  
  
###### 20  
Guard my soul and deliver me; let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in You.  
  
###### 21  
May integrity and uprightness preserve me, because I wait for You.  
  
###### 22  
Redeem Israel, O God, from all its distress.
