###### 1  
Hallelujah! Praise the name of the LORD. Give praise, O servants of the LORD,  
  
###### 2  
who stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.  
  
###### 3  
Hallelujah, for the LORD is good; sing praises to His name, for it is lovely.  
  
###### 4  
For the LORD has chosen Jacob as His own, Israel as His treasured possession.  
  
###### 5  
For I know that the LORD is great; our Lord is above all gods.  
  
###### 6  
The LORD does all that pleases Him in the heavens and on the earth, in the seas and in all their depths.  
  
###### 7  
He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He generates the lightning with the rain and brings forth the wind from His storehouses.  
  
###### 8  
He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, of both man and beast.  
  
###### 9  
He sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants.  
  
###### 10  
He struck down many nations and slaughtered mighty kings:  
  
###### 11  
Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kings of Canaan.  
  
###### 12  
He gave their land as an inheritance, as a heritage to His people Israel.  
  
###### 13  
Your name, O LORD, endures forever, Your renown, O LORD, through all generations.  
  
###### 14  
For the LORD will vindicate His people and will have compassion on His servants.  
  
###### 15  
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, made by the hands of men.  
  
###### 16  
They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see;  
  
###### 17  
they have ears, but cannot hear; nor is there breath in their mouths.  
  
###### 18  
Those who make them become like them, as do all who trust in them.  
  
###### 19  
O house of Israel, bless the LORD; O house of Aaron, bless the LORD;  
  
###### 20  
O house of Levi, bless the LORD; you who fear the LORD, bless the LORD!  
  
###### 21  
Blessed be the LORD from Zion—He who dwells in Jerusalem. Hallelujah!
