###### 1  
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. Hear, O God, my voice of complaint; preserve my life from dread of the enemy.  
  
###### 2  
Hide me from the scheming of the wicked, from the mob of workers of iniquity,  
  
###### 3  
who sharpen their tongues like swords and aim their bitter words like arrows,  
  
###### 4  
ambushing the innocent in seclusion, shooting suddenly, without fear.  
  
###### 5  
They hold fast to their evil purpose; they speak of hiding their snares. “Who will see them?” they say.  
  
###### 6  
They devise injustice and say, “We have perfected a secret plan.” For the inner man and the heart are mysterious.  
  
###### 7  
But God will shoot them with arrows; suddenly they will be wounded.  
  
###### 8  
They will be made to stumble, their own tongues turned against them. All who see will shake their heads.  
  
###### 9  
Then all mankind will fear and proclaim the work of God; so they will ponder what He has done.  
  
###### 10  
Let the righteous rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in Him; let all the upright in heart exult.
