###### 1  
He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.  
  
###### 2  
I will say to the LORD, “You are my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.”  
  
###### 3  
Surely He will deliver you from the snare of the fowler, and from the deadly plague.  
  
###### 4  
He will cover you with His feathers; under His wings you will find refuge; His faithfulness is a shield and rampart.  
  
###### 5  
You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day,  
  
###### 6  
nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the calamity that destroys at noon.  
  
###### 7  
Though a thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand, no harm will come near you.  
  
###### 8  
You will only see it with your eyes and witness the punishment of the wicked.  
  
###### 9  
Because you have made the LORD your dwelling—my refuge, the Most High—  
  
###### 10  
no evil will befall you, no plague will approach your tent.  
  
###### 11  
For He will command His angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.  
  
###### 12  
They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.  
  
###### 13  
You will tread on the lion and cobra; you will trample the young lion and serpent.  
  
###### 14  
“Because he loves Me, I will deliver him; because he knows My name, I will protect him.  
  
###### 15  
When he calls out to Me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver him and honor him.  
  
###### 16  
With long life I will satisfy him and show him My salvation.”
