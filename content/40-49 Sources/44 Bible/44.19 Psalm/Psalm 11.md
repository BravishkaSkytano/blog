###### 1  
For the choirmaster. Of David. In the LORD I take refuge. How then can you say to me: “Flee like a bird to your mountain!  
  
###### 2  
For behold, the wicked bend their bows. They set their arrow on the string to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.  
  
###### 3  
If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?”  
  
###### 4  
The LORD is in His holy temple; the LORD is on His heavenly throne. His eyes are watching closely; they examine the sons of men.  
  
###### 5  
The LORD tests the righteous and the wicked; His soul hates the lover of violence.  
  
###### 6  
On the wicked He will rain down fiery coals and sulfur; a scorching wind will be their portion.  
  
###### 7  
For the LORD is righteous; He loves justice. The upright will see His face.
