###### 1  
A Maskil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my instruction; listen to the words of my mouth.  
  
###### 2  
I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the beginning,  
  
###### 3  
that we have heard and known and our fathers have relayed to us.  
  
###### 4  
We will not hide them from their children, but will declare to the next generation the praises of the LORD and His might, and the wonders He has performed.  
  
###### 5  
For He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which He commanded our fathers to teach to their children,  
  
###### 6  
that the coming generation would know them—even children yet to be born—to arise and tell their own children  
  
###### 7  
that they should put their confidence in God, not forgetting His works, but keeping His commandments.  
  
###### 8  
Then they will not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose heart was not loyal, whose spirit was not faithful to God.  
  
###### 9  
The archers of Ephraim turned back on the day of battle.  
  
###### 10  
They failed to keep God’s covenant and refused to live by His law.  
  
###### 11  
They forgot what He had done, the wonders He had shown them.  
  
###### 12  
He worked wonders before their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.  
  
###### 13  
He split the sea and brought them through; He set the waters upright like a wall.  
  
###### 14  
He led them with a cloud by day and with a light of fire all night.  
  
###### 15  
He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as abundant as the seas.  
  
###### 16  
He brought streams from the stone and made water flow down like rivers.  
  
###### 17  
But they continued to sin against Him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.  
  
###### 18  
They willfully tested God by demanding the food they craved.  
  
###### 19  
They spoke against God, saying, “Can God really prepare a table in the wilderness?  
  
###### 20  
When He struck the rock, water gushed out and torrents raged. But can He also give bread or supply His people with meat?”  
  
###### 21  
Therefore the LORD heard and was filled with wrath; so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and His anger flared against Israel,  
  
###### 22  
because they did not believe God or rely on His salvation.  
  
###### 23  
Yet He commanded the clouds above and opened the doors of the heavens.  
  
###### 24  
He rained down manna for them to eat; He gave them grain from heaven.  
  
###### 25  
Man ate the bread of angels; He sent them food in abundance.  
  
###### 26  
He stirred the east wind from the heavens and drove the south wind by His might.  
  
###### 27  
He rained meat on them like dust, and winged birds like the sand of the sea.  
  
###### 28  
He felled them in the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings.  
  
###### 29  
So they ate and were well filled, for He gave them what they craved.  
  
###### 30  
Yet before they had filled their desire, with the food still in their mouths,  
  
###### 31  
God’s anger flared against them, and He put to death their strongest and subdued the young men of Israel.  
  
###### 32  
In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; despite His wonderful works, they did not believe.  
  
###### 33  
So He ended their days in futility, and their years in sudden terror.  
  
###### 34  
When He slew them, they would seek Him; they repented and searched for God.  
  
###### 35  
And they remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.  
  
###### 36  
But they deceived Him with their mouths, and lied to Him with their tongues.  
  
###### 37  
Their hearts were disloyal to Him, and they were unfaithful to His covenant.  
  
###### 38  
And yet He was compassionate; He forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them. He often restrained His anger and did not unleash His full wrath.  
  
###### 39  
He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.  
  
###### 40  
How often they disobeyed Him in the wilderness and grieved Him in the desert!  
  
###### 41  
Again and again they tested God and provoked the Holy One of Israel.  
  
###### 42  
They did not remember His power—the day He redeemed them from the adversary,  
  
###### 43  
when He performed His signs in Egypt and His wonders in the fields of Zoan.  
  
###### 44  
He turned their rivers to blood, and from their streams they could not drink.  
  
###### 45  
He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.  
  
###### 46  
He gave their crops to the grasshopper, the fruit of their labor to the locust.  
  
###### 47  
He killed their vines with hailstones and their sycamore-figs with sleet.  
  
###### 48  
He abandoned their cattle to the hail and their livestock to bolts of lightning.  
  
###### 49  
He unleashed His fury against them, wrath, indignation, and calamity—a band of destroying angels.  
  
###### 50  
He cleared a path for His anger; He did not spare them from death but delivered their lives to the plague.  
  
###### 51  
He struck all the firstborn of Egypt, the virility in the tents of Ham.  
  
###### 52  
He led out His people like sheep and guided them like a flock in the wilderness.  
  
###### 53  
He led them safely, so they did not fear, but the sea engulfed their enemies.  
  
###### 54  
He brought them to His holy land, to the mountain His right hand had acquired.  
  
###### 55  
He drove out nations before them and apportioned their inheritance; He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.  
  
###### 56  
But they tested and disobeyed God Most High, for they did not keep His decrees.  
  
###### 57  
They turned back and were faithless like their fathers, twisted like a faulty bow.  
  
###### 58  
They enraged Him with their high places and provoked His jealousy with their idols.  
  
###### 59  
On hearing it, God was furious and rejected Israel completely.  
  
###### 60  
He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent He had pitched among men.  
  
###### 61  
He delivered His strength to captivity, and His splendor to the hand of the adversary.  
  
###### 62  
He surrendered His people to the sword because He was enraged by His heritage.  
  
###### 63  
Fire consumed His young men, and their maidens were left without wedding songs.  
  
###### 64  
His priests fell by the sword, but their widows could not lament.  
  
###### 65  
Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a mighty warrior overcome by wine.  
  
###### 66  
He beat back His foes; He put them to everlasting shame.  
  
###### 67  
He rejected the tent of Joseph and refused the tribe of Ephraim.  
  
###### 68  
But He chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which He loved.  
  
###### 69  
He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth He has established forever.  
  
###### 70  
He chose David His servant and took him from the sheepfolds;  
  
###### 71  
from tending the ewes He brought him to be shepherd of His people Jacob, of Israel His inheritance.  
  
###### 72  
So David shepherded them with integrity of heart and guided them with skillful hands.
