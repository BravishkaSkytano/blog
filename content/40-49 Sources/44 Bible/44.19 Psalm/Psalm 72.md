###### 1  
Of Solomon. Endow the king with Your justice, O God, and the son of the king with Your righteousness.  
  
###### 2  
May he judge Your people with righteousness and Your afflicted with justice.  
  
###### 3  
May the mountains bring peace to the people, and the hills bring righteousness.  
  
###### 4  
May he vindicate the afflicted among the people; may he save the children of the needy and crush the oppressor.  
  
###### 5  
May they fear him as long as the sun shines, as long as the moon remains, through all generations.  
  
###### 6  
May he be like rain that falls on freshly cut grass, like spring showers that water the earth.  
  
###### 7  
May the righteous flourish in his days and prosperity abound, until the moon is no more.  
  
###### 8  
May he rule from sea to sea, and from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth.  
  
###### 9  
May the nomads bow before him, and his enemies lick the dust.  
  
###### 10  
May the kings of Tarshish and distant shores bring tribute; may the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.  
  
###### 11  
May all kings bow down to him and all nations serve him.  
  
###### 12  
For he will deliver the needy who cry out and the afflicted who have no helper.  
  
###### 13  
He will take pity on the poor and needy and save the lives of the oppressed.  
  
###### 14  
He will redeem them from oppression and violence, for their blood is precious in his sight.  
  
###### 15  
Long may he live! May gold from Sheba be given him. May people ever pray for him; may they bless him all day long.  
  
###### 16  
May there be an abundance of grain in the land; may it sway atop the hills. May its fruit trees flourish like the forests of Lebanon, and its people like the grass of the field.  
  
###### 17  
May his name endure forever; may his name continue as long as the sun shines. In him may all nations be blessed; may they call him blessed.  
  
###### 18  
Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.  
  
###### 19  
And blessed be His glorious name forever; may all the earth be filled with His glory. Amen and amen.  
  
###### 20  
Thus conclude the prayers of David son of Jesse.
