###### 1  
I love the LORD, for He has heard my voice—my appeal for mercy.  
  
###### 2  
Because He has inclined His ear to me, I will call on Him as long as I live.  
  
###### 3  
The ropes of death entangled me; the anguish of Sheol overcame me; I was confronted by trouble and sorrow.  
  
###### 4  
Then I called on the name of the LORD: “O LORD, deliver my soul!”  
  
###### 5  
The LORD is gracious and righteous; our God is full of compassion.  
  
###### 6  
The LORD preserves the simplehearted; I was helpless, and He saved me.  
  
###### 7  
Return to your rest, O my soul, for the LORD has been good to you.  
  
###### 8  
For You have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling.  
  
###### 9  
I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.  
  
###### 10  
I believed, therefore I said, “I am greatly afflicted.”  
  
###### 11  
In my alarm I said, “All men are liars!”  
  
###### 12  
How can I repay the LORD for all His goodness to me?  
  
###### 13  
I will lift the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD.  
  
###### 14  
I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all His people.  
  
###### 15  
Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints.  
  
###### 16  
Truly, O LORD, I am Your servant; I am Your servant, the son of Your maidservant; You have broken my bonds.  
  
###### 17  
I will offer to You a sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the LORD.  
  
###### 18  
I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all His people,  
  
###### 19  
in the courts of the LORD’s house, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah!
