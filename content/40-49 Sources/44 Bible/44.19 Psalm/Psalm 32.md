###### 1  
Of David. A Maskil. Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.  
  
###### 2  
Blessed is the man whose iniquity the LORD does not count against him, in whose spirit there is no deceit.  
  
###### 3  
When I kept silent, my bones became brittle from my groaning all day long.  
  
###### 4  
For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was drained as in the summer heat. Selah  
  
###### 5  
Then I acknowledged my sin to You and did not hide my iniquity. I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the LORD,” and You forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah  
  
###### 6  
Therefore let all the godly pray to You while You may be found. Surely when great waters rise, they will not come near.  
  
###### 7  
You are my hiding place. You protect me from trouble; You surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah  
  
###### 8  
I will instruct you and teach you the way you should go; I will give you counsel and watch over you.  
  
###### 9  
Do not be like the horse or mule, which have no understanding; they must be controlled with bit and bridle to make them come to you.  
  
###### 10  
Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but loving devotion surrounds him who trusts in the LORD.  
  
###### 11  
Be glad in the LORD and rejoice, O righteous ones; shout for joy, all you upright in heart.
