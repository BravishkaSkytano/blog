###### 1  
When Israel departed from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of foreign tongue,  
  
###### 2  
Judah became God’s sanctuary, and Israel His dominion.  
  
###### 3  
The sea observed and fled; the Jordan turned back;  
  
###### 4  
the mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs.  
  
###### 5  
Why was it, O sea, that you fled, O Jordan, that you turned back,  
  
###### 6  
O mountains, that you skipped like rams, O hills, like lambs?  
  
###### 7  
Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,  
  
###### 8  
who turned the rock into a pool, the flint into a fountain of water!
