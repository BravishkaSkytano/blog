###### 1  
A prayer of one who is afflicted, when he grows faint and pours out his lament before the LORD. Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry for help come before You.  
  
###### 2  
Do not hide Your face from me in my day of distress. Incline Your ear to me; answer me quickly when I call.  
  
###### 3  
For my days vanish like smoke, and my bones burn like glowing embers.  
  
###### 4  
My heart is afflicted, and withered like grass; I even forget to eat my bread.  
  
###### 5  
Through my loud groaning my flesh clings to my bones.  
  
###### 6  
I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins.  
  
###### 7  
I lie awake; I am like a lone bird on a housetop.  
  
###### 8  
All day long my enemies taunt me; they ridicule me and curse me.  
  
###### 9  
For I have eaten ashes like bread and mixed my drink with tears  
  
###### 10  
because of Your indignation and wrath, for You have picked me up and cast me aside.  
  
###### 11  
My days are like lengthening shadows, and I wither away like grass.  
  
###### 12  
But You, O LORD, sit enthroned forever; Your renown endures to all generations.  
  
###### 13  
You will rise up and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show her favor—the appointed time has come.  
  
###### 14  
For Your servants delight in her stones and take pity on her dust.  
  
###### 15  
So the nations will fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth will fear Your glory.  
  
###### 16  
For the LORD will rebuild Zion; He has appeared in His glory.  
  
###### 17  
He will turn toward the prayer of the destitute; He will not despise their prayer.  
  
###### 18  
Let this be written for the generation to come, so that a people not yet created may praise the LORD.  
  
###### 19  
For He looked down from the heights of His sanctuary; the LORD gazed out from heaven to earth  
  
###### 20  
to hear a prisoner’s groaning, to release those condemned to death,  
  
###### 21  
that they may proclaim the name of the LORD in Zion and praise Him in Jerusalem,  
  
###### 22  
when peoples and kingdoms assemble to serve the LORD.  
  
###### 23  
He has broken my strength on the way; He has cut short my days.  
  
###### 24  
I say: “O my God, do not take me in the midst of my days! Your years go on through all generations.  
  
###### 25  
In the beginning You laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands.  
  
###### 26  
They will perish, but You remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing You will change them, and they will be passed on.  
  
###### 27  
But You remain the same, and Your years will never end.  
  
###### 28  
The children of Your servants will dwell securely, and their descendants will be established before You.”
