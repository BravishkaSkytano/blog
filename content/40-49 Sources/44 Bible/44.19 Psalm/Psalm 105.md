###### 1  
Give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name; make known His deeds among the nations.  
  
###### 2  
Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; tell of all His wonders.  
  
###### 3  
Glory in His holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.  
  
###### 4  
Seek out the LORD and His strength; seek His face always.  
  
###### 5  
Remember the wonders He has done, His marvels, and the judgments He has pronounced,  
  
###### 6  
O offspring of His servant Abraham, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.  
  
###### 7  
He is the LORD our God; His judgments carry throughout the earth.  
  
###### 8  
He remembers His covenant forever, the word He ordained for a thousand generations—  
  
###### 9  
the covenant He made with Abraham, and the oath He swore to Isaac.  
  
###### 10  
He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:  
  
###### 11  
“I will give you the land of Canaan as the portion of your inheritance.”  
  
###### 12  
When they were few in number, few indeed, and strangers in the land,  
  
###### 13  
they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.  
  
###### 14  
He let no man oppress them; He rebuked kings on their behalf:  
  
###### 15  
“Do not touch My anointed ones! Do no harm to My prophets!”  
  
###### 16  
He called down famine on the land and cut off all their supplies of food.  
  
###### 17  
He sent a man before them—Joseph, sold as a slave.  
  
###### 18  
They bruised his feet with shackles and placed his neck in irons,  
  
###### 19  
until his prediction came true and the word of the LORD proved him right.  
  
###### 20  
The king sent and released him; the ruler of peoples set him free.  
  
###### 21  
He made him master of his household, ruler over all his substance,  
  
###### 22  
to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.  
  
###### 23  
Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob dwelt in the land of Ham.  
  
###### 24  
And the LORD made His people very fruitful, more numerous than their foes,  
  
###### 25  
whose hearts He turned to hate His people, to conspire against His servants.  
  
###### 26  
He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron, whom He had chosen.  
  
###### 27  
They performed His miraculous signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.  
  
###### 28  
He sent darkness, and it became dark—yet they defied His words.  
  
###### 29  
He turned their waters to blood and caused their fish to die.  
  
###### 30  
Their land teemed with frogs, even in their royal chambers.  
  
###### 31  
He spoke, and insects swarmed—gnats throughout their country.  
  
###### 32  
He gave them hail for rain, with lightning throughout their land.  
  
###### 33  
He struck their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.  
  
###### 34  
He spoke, and the locusts came—young locusts without number.  
  
###### 35  
They devoured every plant in their land and consumed the produce of their soil.  
  
###### 36  
Then He struck all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their vigor.  
  
###### 37  
He brought Israel out with silver and gold, and none among His tribes stumbled.  
  
###### 38  
Egypt was glad when they departed, for the dread of Israel had fallen on them.  
  
###### 39  
He spread a cloud as a covering and a fire to light up the night.  
  
###### 40  
They asked, and He brought quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.  
  
###### 41  
He opened a rock, and water gushed out; it flowed like a river in the desert.  
  
###### 42  
For He remembered His holy promise to Abraham His servant.  
  
###### 43  
He brought forth His people with rejoicing, His chosen with shouts of joy.  
  
###### 44  
He gave them the lands of the nations, that they might inherit the fruit of others’ labor,  
  
###### 45  
that they might keep His statutes and obey His laws. Hallelujah!
