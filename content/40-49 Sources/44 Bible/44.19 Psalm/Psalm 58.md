###### 1  
For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam of David. Do you indeed speak justly, O rulers? Do you judge uprightly, O sons of men?  
  
###### 2  
No, in your hearts you devise injustice; with your hands you mete out violence on the earth.  
  
###### 3  
The wicked are estranged from the womb; the liars go astray from birth.  
  
###### 4  
Their venom is like the venom of a snake, like a cobra that shuts its ears,  
  
###### 5  
refusing to hear the tune of the charmer who skillfully weaves his spell.  
  
###### 6  
O God, shatter their teeth in their mouths; O LORD, tear out the fangs of the lions.  
  
###### 7  
May they vanish like water that runs off; when they draw the bow, may their arrows be blunted.  
  
###### 8  
Like a slug that dissolves in its slime, like a woman’s stillborn child, may they never see the sun.  
  
###### 9  
Before your pots can feel the burning thorns—whether green or dry—He will sweep them away.  
  
###### 10  
The righteous will rejoice when they see they are avenged; they will wash their feet in the blood of the wicked.  
  
###### 11  
Then men will say, “There is surely a reward for the righteous! There is surely a God who judges the earth!”
