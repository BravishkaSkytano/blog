###### 1  
A song. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. For the choirmaster. According to Mahalath Leannoth. A Maskil of Heman the Ezrahite. O LORD, the God of my salvation, day and night I cry out before You.  
  
###### 2  
May my prayer come before You; incline Your ear to my cry.  
  
###### 3  
For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to Sheol.  
  
###### 4  
I am counted among those descending to the Pit. I am like a man without strength.  
  
###### 5  
I am forsaken among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom You remember no more, who are cut off from Your care.  
  
###### 6  
You have laid me in the lowest Pit, in the darkest of the depths.  
  
###### 7  
Your wrath weighs heavily upon me; all Your waves have submerged me. Selah  
  
###### 8  
You have removed my friends from me; You have made me repulsive to them; I am confined and cannot escape.  
  
###### 9  
My eyes grow dim with grief. I call to You daily, O LORD; I spread out my hands to You.  
  
###### 10  
Do You work wonders for the dead? Do departed spirits rise up to praise You? Selah  
  
###### 11  
Can Your loving devotion be proclaimed in the grave, Your faithfulness in Abaddon?  
  
###### 12  
Will Your wonders be known in the darkness, or Your righteousness in the land of oblivion?  
  
###### 13  
But to You, O LORD, I cry for help; in the morning my prayer comes before You.  
  
###### 14  
Why, O LORD, do You reject me? Why do You hide Your face from me?  
  
###### 15  
From my youth I was afflicted and near death. I have borne Your terrors; I am in despair.  
  
###### 16  
Your wrath has swept over me; Your terrors have destroyed me.  
  
###### 17  
All day long they engulf me like water; they enclose me on every side.  
  
###### 18  
You have removed my beloved and my friend; darkness is my closest companion.
