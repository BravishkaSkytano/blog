###### 1  
A Psalm of Asaph. The Mighty One, God the LORD, speaks and summons the earth from where the sun rises to where it sets.  
  
###### 2  
From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth.  
  
###### 3  
Our God approaches and will not be silent! Consuming fire precedes Him, and a tempest rages around Him.  
  
###### 4  
He summons the heavens above, and the earth, that He may judge His people:  
  
###### 5  
“Gather to Me My saints, who made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.”  
  
###### 6  
And the heavens proclaim His righteousness, for God Himself is Judge. Selah  
  
###### 7  
“Hear, O My people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you: I am God, your God.  
  
###### 8  
I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices, and your burnt offerings are ever before Me.  
  
###### 9  
I have no need for a bull from your stall or goats from your pens,  
  
###### 10  
for every beast of the forest is Mine—the cattle on a thousand hills.  
  
###### 11  
I know every bird in the mountains, and the creatures of the field are Mine.  
  
###### 12  
If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is Mine, and the fullness thereof.  
  
###### 13  
Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?  
  
###### 14  
Sacrifice a thank offering to God, and fulfill your vows to the Most High.  
  
###### 15  
Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor Me.”  
  
###### 16  
To the wicked, however, God says, “What right have you to recite My statutes and to bear My covenant on your lips?  
  
###### 17  
For you hate My instruction and cast My words behind you.  
  
###### 18  
When you see a thief, you befriend him, and throw in your lot with adulterers.  
  
###### 19  
You unleash your mouth for evil and unharness your tongue for deceit.  
  
###### 20  
You sit and malign your brother; you slander your own mother’s son.  
  
###### 21  
You have done these things, and I kept silent; you thought I was just like you. But now I rebuke you and accuse you to your face.  
  
###### 22  
Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you to pieces, with no one to rescue you:  
  
###### 23  
He who sacrifices a thank offering honors Me, and to him who rights his way, I will show the salvation of God.”
