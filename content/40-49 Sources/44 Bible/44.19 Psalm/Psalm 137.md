###### 1  
By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept when we remembered Zion.  
  
###### 2  
There on the willows we hung our harps,  
  
###### 3  
for there our captors requested a song; our tormentors demanded songs of joy: “Sing us a song of Zion.”  
  
###### 4  
How can we sing a song of the LORD in a foreign land?  
  
###### 5  
If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand cease to function.  
  
###### 6  
May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you, if I do not exalt Jerusalem as my greatest joy!  
  
###### 7  
Remember, O LORD, the sons of Edom on the day Jerusalem fell: “Destroy it,” they said, “tear it down to its foundations!”  
  
###### 8  
O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, blessed is he who repays you as you have done to us.  
  
###### 9  
Blessed is he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.
