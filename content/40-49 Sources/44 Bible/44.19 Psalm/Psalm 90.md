###### 1  
A prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, You have been our dwelling place through all generations.  
  
###### 2  
Before the mountains were born or You brought forth the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting You are God.  
  
###### 3  
You return man to dust, saying, “Return, O sons of mortals.”  
  
###### 4  
For in Your sight a thousand years are but a day that passes, or a watch of the night.  
  
###### 5  
You whisk them away in their sleep; they are like the new grass of the morning—  
  
###### 6  
in the morning it springs up new, but by evening it fades and withers.  
  
###### 7  
For we are consumed by Your anger and terrified by Your wrath.  
  
###### 8  
You have set our iniquities before You, our secret sins in the light of Your presence.  
  
###### 9  
For all our days decline in Your fury; we finish our years with a sigh.  
  
###### 10  
The length of our days is seventy years—or eighty if we are strong—yet their pride is but labor and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away.  
  
###### 11  
Who knows the power of Your anger? Your wrath matches the fear You are due.  
  
###### 12  
So teach us to number our days, that we may present a heart of wisdom.  
  
###### 13  
Return, O LORD! How long will it be? Have compassion on Your servants.  
  
###### 14  
Satisfy us in the morning with Your loving devotion, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.  
  
###### 15  
Make us glad for as many days as You have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen evil.  
  
###### 16  
May Your work be shown to Your servants, and Your splendor to their children.  
  
###### 17  
May the favor of the Lord our God rest upon us; establish for us the work of our hands—yes, establish the work of our hands!
