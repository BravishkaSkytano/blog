###### 1  
Of David. Bless the LORD, O my soul; all that is within me, bless His holy name.  
  
###### 2  
Bless the LORD, O my soul, and do not forget all His kind deeds—  
  
###### 3  
He who forgives all your iniquities and heals all your diseases,  
  
###### 4  
who redeems your life from the Pit and crowns you with loving devotion and compassion,  
  
###### 5  
who satisfies you with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.  
  
###### 6  
The LORD executes righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.  
  
###### 7  
He made known His ways to Moses, His deeds to the people of Israel.  
  
###### 8  
The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion.  
  
###### 9  
He will not always accuse us, nor harbor His anger forever.  
  
###### 10  
He has not dealt with us according to our sins or repaid us according to our iniquities.  
  
###### 11  
For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is His loving devotion for those who fear Him.  
  
###### 12  
As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.  
  
###### 13  
As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear Him.  
  
###### 14  
For He knows our frame; He is mindful that we are dust.  
  
###### 15  
As for man, his days are like grass—he blooms like a flower of the field;  
  
###### 16  
when the wind passes over, it vanishes, and its place remembers it no more.  
  
###### 17  
But from everlasting to everlasting the loving devotion of the LORD extends to those who fear Him, and His righteousness to their children’s children—  
  
###### 18  
to those who keep His covenant and remember to obey His precepts.  
  
###### 19  
The LORD has established His throne in heaven, and His kingdom rules over all.  
  
###### 20  
Bless the LORD, all His angels mighty in strength who carry out His word, who hearken to the voice of His command.  
  
###### 21  
Bless the LORD, all His hosts, you servants who do His will.  
  
###### 22  
Bless the LORD, all His works in all places of His dominion. Bless the LORD, O my soul!
