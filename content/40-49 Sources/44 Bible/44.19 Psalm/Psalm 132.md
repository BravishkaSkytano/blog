###### 1  
A song of ascents. O LORD, remember on behalf of David all the hardships he endured,  
  
###### 2  
how he swore an oath to the LORD, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:  
  
###### 3  
“I will not enter my house or get into my bed,  
  
###### 4  
I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids,  
  
###### 5  
until I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”  
  
###### 6  
We heard that the ark was in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar.  
  
###### 7  
Let us go to His dwelling place; let us worship at His footstool.  
  
###### 8  
Arise, O LORD, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength.  
  
###### 9  
May Your priests be clothed with righteousness, and Your saints shout for joy.  
  
###### 10  
For the sake of Your servant David, do not reject Your anointed one.  
  
###### 11  
The LORD swore an oath to David, a promise He will not revoke: “One of your descendants I will place on your throne.  
  
###### 12  
If your sons keep My covenant and the testimony I will teach them, then their sons will also sit on your throne forever and ever.”  
  
###### 13  
For the LORD has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His home:  
  
###### 14  
“This is My resting place forever and ever; here I will dwell, for I have desired this home.  
  
###### 15  
I will bless her with abundant provisions; I will satisfy her poor with bread.  
  
###### 16  
I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints will sing out in joy.  
  
###### 17  
There I will make a horn grow for David; I have prepared a lamp for My anointed one.  
  
###### 18  
I will clothe his enemies with shame, but the crown upon him will gleam.”
