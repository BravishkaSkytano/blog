###### 1  
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. Rescue me, O LORD, from evil men. Protect me from men of violence,  
  
###### 2  
who devise evil in their hearts and stir up war all day long.  
  
###### 3  
They sharpen their tongues like snakes; the venom of vipers is on their lips. Selah  
  
###### 4  
Guard me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked. Keep me safe from men of violence who scheme to make me stumble.  
  
###### 5  
The proud hide a snare for me; the cords of their net are spread along the path, and lures are set out for me. Selah  
  
###### 6  
I say to the LORD, “You are my God.” Hear, O LORD, my cry for help.  
  
###### 7  
O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, You shield my head in the day of battle.  
  
###### 8  
Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; do not promote their evil plans, lest they be exalted. Selah  
  
###### 9  
May the heads of those who surround me be covered in the trouble their lips have caused.  
  
###### 10  
May burning coals fall on them; may they be thrown into the fire, into the miry pits, never to rise again.  
  
###### 11  
May no slanderer be established in the land; may calamity hunt down the man of violence.  
  
###### 12  
I know that the LORD upholds justice for the poor and defends the cause of the needy.  
  
###### 13  
Surely the righteous will praise Your name; the upright will dwell in Your presence.
