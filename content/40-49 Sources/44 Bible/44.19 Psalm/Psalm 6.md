###### 1  
For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments, according to Sheminith. A Psalm of David. O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger or discipline me in Your wrath.  
  
###### 2  
Be merciful to me, O LORD, for I am frail; heal me, O LORD, for my bones are in agony.  
  
###### 3  
My soul is deeply distressed. How long, O LORD, how long?  
  
###### 4  
Turn, O LORD, and deliver my soul; save me because of Your loving devotion.  
  
###### 5  
For there is no mention of You in death; who can praise You from Sheol?  
  
###### 6  
I am weary from groaning; all night I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.  
  
###### 7  
My eyes fail from grief; they grow dim because of all my foes.  
  
###### 8  
Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, for the LORD has heard my weeping.  
  
###### 9  
The LORD has heard my cry for mercy; the LORD accepts my prayer.  
  
###### 10  
All my enemies will be ashamed and dismayed; they will turn back in sudden disgrace.
