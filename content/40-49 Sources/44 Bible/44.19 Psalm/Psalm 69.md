###### 1  
For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Lilies.” Of David. Save me, O God, for the waters are up to my neck.  
  
###### 2  
I have sunk into the miry depths, where there is no footing; I have drifted into deep waters, where the flood engulfs me.  
  
###### 3  
I am weary from my crying; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God.  
  
###### 4  
Those who hate me without cause outnumber the hairs of my head; many are those who would destroy me—my enemies for no reason. Though I did not steal, I must repay.  
  
###### 5  
You know my folly, O God, and my guilt is not hidden from You.  
  
###### 6  
May those who hope in You not be ashamed through me, O Lord GOD of Hosts; may those who seek You not be dishonored through me, O God of Israel.  
  
###### 7  
For I have endured scorn for Your sake, and shame has covered my face.  
  
###### 8  
I have become a stranger to my brothers and a foreigner to my mother’s sons,  
  
###### 9  
because zeal for Your house has consumed me, and the insults of those who insult You have fallen on me.  
  
###### 10  
I wept and fasted, but it brought me reproach.  
  
###### 11  
I made sackcloth my clothing, and I was sport to them.  
  
###### 12  
Those who sit at the gate mock me, and I am the song of drunkards.  
  
###### 13  
But my prayer to You, O LORD, is for a time of favor. In Your abundant loving devotion, O God, answer me with Your sure salvation.  
  
###### 14  
Rescue me from the mire and do not let me sink; deliver me from my foes and out of the deep waters.  
  
###### 15  
Do not let the floods engulf me or the depths swallow me up; let not the Pit close its mouth over me.  
  
###### 16  
Answer me, O LORD, for Your loving devotion is good; turn to me in keeping with Your great compassion.  
  
###### 17  
Hide not Your face from Your servant, for I am in distress. Answer me quickly!  
  
###### 18  
Draw near to my soul and redeem me; ransom me because of my foes.  
  
###### 19  
You know my reproach, my shame and disgrace. All my adversaries are before You.  
  
###### 20  
Insults have broken my heart, and I am in despair. I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comforters, but I found no one.  
  
###### 21  
They poisoned my food with gall and gave me vinegar to quench my thirst.  
  
###### 22  
May their table become a snare; may it be a retribution and a trap.  
  
###### 23  
May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.  
  
###### 24  
Pour out Your wrath upon them, and let Your burning anger overtake them.  
  
###### 25  
May their place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in their tents.  
  
###### 26  
For they persecute the one You struck and recount the pain of those You wounded.  
  
###### 27  
Add iniquity to their iniquity; let them not share in Your righteousness.  
  
###### 28  
May they be blotted out of the Book of Life and not listed with the righteous.  
  
###### 29  
But I am in pain and distress; let Your salvation protect me, O God.  
  
###### 30  
I will praise God’s name in song and exalt Him with thanksgiving.  
  
###### 31  
And this will please the LORD more than an ox, more than a bull with horns and hooves.  
  
###### 32  
The humble will see and rejoice. You who seek God, let your hearts be revived!  
  
###### 33  
For the LORD listens to the needy and does not despise His captive people.  
  
###### 34  
Let heaven and earth praise Him, the seas and everything that moves in them.  
  
###### 35  
For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah, that they may dwell there and possess it.  
  
###### 36  
The descendants of His servants will inherit it, and those who love His name will settle in it.
