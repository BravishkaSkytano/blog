###### 1  
For the choirmaster, to be accompanied by flutes. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my groaning.  
  
###### 2  
Attend to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to You I pray.  
  
###### 3  
In the morning, O LORD, You hear my voice; at daybreak I lay my plea before You and wait in expectation.  
  
###### 4  
For You are not a God who delights in wickedness; no evil can dwell with You.  
  
###### 5  
The boastful cannot stand in Your presence; You hate all workers of iniquity.  
  
###### 6  
You destroy those who tell lies; the LORD abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.  
  
###### 7  
But I will enter Your house by the abundance of Your loving devotion; in reverence I will bow down toward Your holy temple.  
  
###### 8  
Lead me, O LORD, in Your righteousness because of my enemies; make straight Your way before me.  
  
###### 9  
For not a word they speak can be trusted; destruction lies within them. Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.  
  
###### 10  
Declare them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own devices. Drive them out for their many transgressions, for they have rebelled against You.  
  
###### 11  
But let all who take refuge in You rejoice; let them ever shout for joy. May You shelter them, that those who love Your name may rejoice in You.  
  
###### 12  
For surely You, O LORD, bless the righteous; You surround them with the shield of Your favor.
