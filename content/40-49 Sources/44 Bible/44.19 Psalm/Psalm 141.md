###### 1  
A Psalm of David. I call upon You, O LORD; come quickly to me. Hear my voice when I call to You.  
  
###### 2  
May my prayer be set before You like incense, my uplifted hands like the evening offering.  
  
###### 3  
Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips.  
  
###### 4  
Do not let my heart be drawn to any evil thing or take part in works of wickedness with men who do iniquity; let me not feast on their delicacies.  
  
###### 5  
Let the righteous man strike me; let his rebuke be an act of loving devotion. It is oil for my head; let me not refuse it. For my prayer is ever against the deeds of the wicked.  
  
###### 6  
When their rulers are thrown down from the cliffs, the people will listen to my words, for they are pleasant.  
  
###### 7  
As when one plows and breaks up the soil, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.  
  
###### 8  
But my eyes are fixed on You, O GOD the Lord. In You I seek refuge; do not leave my soul defenseless.  
  
###### 9  
Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, and from the lures of evildoers.  
  
###### 10  
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety.
