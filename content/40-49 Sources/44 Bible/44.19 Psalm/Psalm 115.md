###### 1  
Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to Your name be the glory, because of Your loving devotion, because of Your faithfulness.  
  
###### 2  
Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”  
  
###### 3  
Our God is in heaven; He does as He pleases.  
  
###### 4  
Their idols are silver and gold, made by the hands of men.  
  
###### 5  
They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see;  
  
###### 6  
they have ears, but cannot hear; they have noses, but cannot smell;  
  
###### 7  
they have hands, but cannot feel; they have feet, but cannot walk; they cannot even clear their throats.  
  
###### 8  
Those who make them become like them, as do all who trust in them.  
  
###### 9  
O Israel, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield.  
  
###### 10  
O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield.  
  
###### 11  
You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield.  
  
###### 12  
The LORD is mindful of us; He will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron;  
  
###### 13  
He will bless those who fear the LORD—small and great alike.  
  
###### 14  
May the LORD give you increase, both you and your children.  
  
###### 15  
May you be blessed by the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.  
  
###### 16  
The highest heavens belong to the LORD, but the earth He has given to mankind.  
  
###### 17  
It is not the dead who praise the LORD, nor any who descend into silence.  
  
###### 18  
But it is we who will bless the LORD, both now and forevermore. Hallelujah!
