###### 1  
Why, O LORD, do You stand far off? Why do You hide in times of trouble?  
  
###### 2  
In pride the wicked pursue the needy; let them be caught in the schemes they devise.  
  
###### 3  
For the wicked man boasts in the cravings of his heart; he blesses the greedy and reviles the LORD.  
  
###### 4  
In his pride the wicked man does not seek Him; in all his schemes there is no God.  
  
###### 5  
He is secure in his ways at all times; Your lofty judgments are far from him; he sneers at all his foes.  
  
###### 6  
He says to himself, “I will not be moved; from age to age I am free of distress.”  
  
###### 7  
His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and violence; trouble and malice are under his tongue.  
  
###### 8  
He lies in wait near the villages; in ambush he slays the innocent; his eyes watch in stealth for the helpless.  
  
###### 9  
He lies in wait like a lion in a thicket; he lurks to seize the oppressed; he catches the lowly in his net.  
  
###### 10  
They are crushed and beaten down; the hapless fall prey to his strength.  
  
###### 11  
He says to himself, “God has forgotten; He hides His face and never sees.”  
  
###### 12  
Arise, O LORD! Lift up Your hand, O God! Do not forget the helpless.  
  
###### 13  
Why has the wicked man renounced God? He says to himself, “You will never call me to account.”  
  
###### 14  
But You have regarded trouble and grief; You see to repay it by Your hand. The victim entrusts himself to You; You are the helper of the fatherless.  
  
###### 15  
Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer; call him to account for his wickedness until none is left to be found.  
  
###### 16  
The LORD is King forever and ever; the nations perish from His land.  
  
###### 17  
You have heard, O LORD, the desire of the humble; You will strengthen their hearts. You will incline Your ear,  
  
###### 18  
to vindicate the fatherless and oppressed, that the men of the earth may strike terror no more.
