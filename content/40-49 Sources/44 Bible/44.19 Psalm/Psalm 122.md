###### 1  
A song of ascents. Of David. I was glad when they said to me, “Let us go to the house of the LORD.”  
  
###### 2  
Our feet are standing in your gates, O Jerusalem.  
  
###### 3  
Jerusalem is built up as a city united together,  
  
###### 4  
where the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the LORD.  
  
###### 5  
For there the thrones of judgment stand, the thrones of the house of David.  
  
###### 6  
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: “May those who love you prosper.  
  
###### 7  
May there be peace within your walls, and prosperity inside your fortresses.”  
  
###### 8  
For the sake of my brothers and friends, I will say, “Peace be within you.”  
  
###### 9  
For the sake of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your prosperity.
