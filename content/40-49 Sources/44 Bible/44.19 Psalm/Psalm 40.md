###### 1  
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the LORD; He inclined to me and heard my cry.  
  
###### 2  
He lifted me up from the pit of despair, out of the miry clay; He set my feet upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm.  
  
###### 3  
He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put their trust in the LORD.  
  
###### 4  
Blessed is the man who has made the LORD his trust, who has not turned to the proud, nor to those who lapse into falsehood.  
  
###### 5  
Many, O LORD my God, are the wonders You have done, and the plans You have for us—none can compare to You—if I proclaim and declare them, they are more than I can count.  
  
###### 6  
Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but my ears You have opened. Burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not require.  
  
###### 7  
Then I said, “Here I am, I have come—it is written about me in the scroll:  
  
###### 8  
I delight to do Your will, O my God; Your law is within my heart.”  
  
###### 9  
I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly; behold, I do not seal my lips, as You, O LORD, do know.  
  
###### 10  
I have not covered up Your righteousness in my heart; I have declared Your faithfulness and salvation; I have not concealed Your loving devotion and faithfulness from the great assembly.  
  
###### 11  
O LORD, do not withhold Your mercy from me; Your loving devotion and faithfulness will always guard me.  
  
###### 12  
For evils without number surround me; my sins have overtaken me, so that I cannot see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart has failed within me.  
  
###### 13  
Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; hurry, O LORD, to help me.  
  
###### 14  
May those who seek my life be ashamed and confounded; may those who wish me harm be repelled and humiliated.  
  
###### 15  
May those who say to me, “Aha, aha!” be appalled at their own shame.  
  
###### 16  
May all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; may those who love Your salvation always say, “The LORD be magnified!”  
  
###### 17  
But I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me. You are my helper and deliverer; O my God, do not delay.
