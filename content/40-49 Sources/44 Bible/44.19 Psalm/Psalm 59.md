###### 1  
For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam of David, when Saul sent men to watch David’s house in order to kill him. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; protect me from those who rise against me.  
  
###### 2  
Deliver me from workers of iniquity, and save me from men of bloodshed.  
  
###### 3  
See how they lie in wait for me. Fierce men conspire against me for no transgression or sin of my own, O LORD.  
  
###### 4  
For no fault of my own, they move swiftly to attack me. Arise to help me, and take notice.  
  
###### 5  
O LORD God of Hosts, the God of Israel, rouse Yourself to punish all the nations; show no mercy to the wicked traitors. Selah  
  
###### 6  
They return in the evening, snarling like dogs and prowling around the city.  
  
###### 7  
See what they spew from their mouths—sharp words from their lips: “For who can hear us?”  
  
###### 8  
But You, O LORD, laugh at them; You scoff at all the nations.  
  
###### 9  
I will keep watch for You, O my strength, because You, O God, are my fortress.  
  
###### 10  
My God of loving devotion will come to meet me; God will let me stare down my foes.  
  
###### 11  
Do not kill them, or my people will forget. Scatter them by Your power, and bring them down, O Lord, our shield.  
  
###### 12  
By the sins of their mouths and the words of their lips, let them be trapped in their pride, in the curses and lies they utter.  
  
###### 13  
Consume them in wrath; consume them till they are no more, so it may be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob. Selah  
  
###### 14  
They return in the evening, snarling like dogs and prowling around the city.  
  
###### 15  
They scavenge for food, and growl if they are not satisfied.  
  
###### 16  
But I will sing of Your strength and proclaim Your loving devotion in the morning. For You are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble.  
  
###### 17  
To You, O my strength, I sing praises, for You, O God, are my fortress, my God of loving devotion.
