###### 1  
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD. An oracle is in my heart regarding the transgression of the wicked man: There is no fear of God before his eyes.  
  
###### 2  
For his eyes are too full of conceit to detect or hate his own sin.  
  
###### 3  
The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; he has ceased to be wise and well-doing.  
  
###### 4  
Even on his bed he plots wickedness; he sets himself on a path that is not good; he fails to reject evil.  
  
###### 5  
Your loving devotion, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, Your faithfulness to the clouds.  
  
###### 6  
Your righteousness is like the highest mountains; Your judgments are like the deepest sea. O LORD, You preserve man and beast.  
  
###### 7  
How precious is Your loving devotion, O God, that the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings!  
  
###### 8  
They feast on the abundance of Your house, and You give them drink from Your river of delights.  
  
###### 9  
For with You is the fountain of life; in Your light we see light.  
  
###### 10  
Extend Your loving devotion to those who know You, and Your righteousness to the upright in heart.  
  
###### 11  
Let not the foot of the proud come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.  
  
###### 12  
There the evildoers lie fallen, thrown down and unable to rise.
