###### 1  
A Psalm of David. O LORD, who may abide in Your tent? Who may dwell on Your holy mountain?  
  
###### 2  
He who walks with integrity and practices righteousness, who speaks the truth from his heart,  
  
###### 3  
who has no slander on his tongue, who does no harm to his neighbor, who casts no scorn on his friend,  
  
###### 4  
who despises the vile but honors those who fear the LORD, who does not revise a costly oath,  
  
###### 5  
who lends his money without interest and refuses a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken.
