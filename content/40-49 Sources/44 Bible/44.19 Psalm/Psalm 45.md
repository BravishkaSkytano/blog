###### 1  
For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Lilies.” A Maskil of the sons of Korah. A love song. My heart is stirred by a noble theme as I recite my verses to the king; my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer.  
  
###### 2  
You are the most handsome of men; grace has anointed your lips, since God has blessed you forever.  
  
###### 3  
Strap your sword at your side, O mighty warrior; appear in your majesty and splendor.  
  
###### 4  
In your splendor ride forth in victory on behalf of truth and humility and justice; may your right hand show your awesome deeds.  
  
###### 5  
Your arrows pierce the hearts of the king’s foes; the nations fall beneath your feet.  
  
###### 6  
Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever, and justice is the scepter of Your kingdom.  
  
###### 7  
You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you above your companions with the oil of joy.  
  
###### 8  
All your garments are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia; from palaces of ivory the harps make you glad.  
  
###### 9  
The daughters of kings are among your honored women; the queen stands at your right hand, adorned with the gold of Ophir.  
  
###### 10  
Listen, O daughter! Consider and incline your ear: Forget your people and your father’s house,  
  
###### 11  
and the king will desire your beauty; bow to him, for he is your lord.  
  
###### 12  
The Daughter of Tyre will come with a gift; men of wealth will seek your favor.  
  
###### 13  
All glorious is the princess in her chamber; her gown is embroidered with gold.  
  
###### 14  
In colorful garments she is led to the king; her virgin companions are brought before you.  
  
###### 15  
They are led in with joy and gladness; they enter the palace of the king.  
  
###### 16  
Your sons will succeed your fathers; you will make them princes throughout the land.  
  
###### 17  
I will commemorate your name through all generations; therefore the nations will praise you forever and ever.
