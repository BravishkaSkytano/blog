###### 1  
A Psalm of David. I will sing of Your loving devotion and justice; to You, O LORD, I will sing praises.  
  
###### 2  
I will ponder the way that is blameless—when will You come to me? I will walk in my house with integrity of heart.  
  
###### 3  
I will set no worthless thing before my eyes. I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cling to me.  
  
###### 4  
A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will know nothing of evil.  
  
###### 5  
Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, I will put to silence; the one with haughty eyes and a proud heart, I will not endure.  
  
###### 6  
My eyes favor the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he who walks in the way of integrity shall minister to me.  
  
###### 7  
No one who practices deceit shall dwell in my house; no one who tells lies shall stand in my presence.  
  
###### 8  
Every morning I will remove all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off every evildoer from the city of the LORD.
