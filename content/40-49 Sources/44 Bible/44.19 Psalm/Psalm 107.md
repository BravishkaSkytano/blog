###### 1  
Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.  
  
###### 2  
Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy  
  
###### 3  
and gathered from the lands, from east and west, from north and south.  
  
###### 4  
Some wandered in desert wastelands, finding no path to a city in which to dwell.  
  
###### 5  
They were hungry and thirsty; their soul fainted within them.  
  
###### 6  
Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He delivered them from their distress.  
  
###### 7  
He led them on a straight path to reach a city where they could live.  
  
###### 8  
Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.  
  
###### 9  
For He satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.  
  
###### 10  
Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction and chains,  
  
###### 11  
because they rebelled against the words of God and despised the counsel of the Most High.  
  
###### 12  
He humbled their hearts with hard labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.  
  
###### 13  
Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them from their distress.  
  
###### 14  
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and broke away their chains.  
  
###### 15  
Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.  
  
###### 16  
For He has broken down the gates of bronze and cut through the bars of iron.  
  
###### 17  
Fools, in their rebellious ways, and through their iniquities, suffered affliction.  
  
###### 18  
They loathed all food and drew near to the gates of death.  
  
###### 19  
Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them from their distress.  
  
###### 20  
He sent forth His word and healed them; He rescued them from the Pit.  
  
###### 21  
Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.  
  
###### 22  
Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare His works with rejoicing.  
  
###### 23  
Others went out to sea in ships, conducting trade on the mighty waters.  
  
###### 24  
They saw the works of the LORD, and His wonders in the deep.  
  
###### 25  
For He spoke and raised a tempest that lifted the waves of the sea.  
  
###### 26  
They mounted up to the heavens, then sunk to the depths; their courage melted in their anguish.  
  
###### 27  
They reeled and staggered like drunkards, and all their skill was useless.  
  
###### 28  
Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He brought them out of their distress.  
  
###### 29  
He calmed the storm to a whisper, and the waves of the sea were hushed.  
  
###### 30  
They rejoiced in the silence, and He guided them to the harbor they desired.  
  
###### 31  
Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.  
  
###### 32  
Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people and praise Him in the council of the elders.  
  
###### 33  
He turns rivers into deserts, springs of water into thirsty ground,  
  
###### 34  
and fruitful land into fields of salt, because of the wickedness of its dwellers.  
  
###### 35  
He turns a desert into pools of water and a dry land into flowing springs.  
  
###### 36  
He causes the hungry to settle there, that they may establish a city in which to dwell.  
  
###### 37  
They sow fields and plant vineyards that yield a fruitful harvest.  
  
###### 38  
He blesses them, and they multiply greatly; He does not let their herds diminish.  
  
###### 39  
When they are decreased and humbled by oppression, evil, and sorrow,  
  
###### 40  
He pours out contempt on the nobles and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland.  
  
###### 41  
But He lifts the needy from affliction and increases their families like flocks.  
  
###### 42  
The upright see and rejoice, and all iniquity shuts its mouth.  
  
###### 43  
Let him who is wise pay heed to these things and consider the loving devotion of the LORD.
