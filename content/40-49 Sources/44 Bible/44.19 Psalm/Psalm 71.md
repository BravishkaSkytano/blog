###### 1  
In You, O LORD, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame.  
  
###### 2  
In Your justice, rescue and deliver me; incline Your ear and save me.  
  
###### 3  
Be my rock of refuge, where I can always go. Give the command to save me, for You are my rock and my fortress.  
  
###### 4  
Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and ruthless.  
  
###### 5  
For You are my hope, O Lord GOD, my confidence from my youth.  
  
###### 6  
I have leaned on You since birth; You pulled me from my mother’s womb. My praise is always for You.  
  
###### 7  
I have become a portent to many, but You are my strong refuge.  
  
###### 8  
My mouth is filled with Your praise and with Your splendor all day long.  
  
###### 9  
Do not discard me in my old age; do not forsake me when my strength fails.  
  
###### 10  
For my enemies speak against me, and those who lie in wait for my life conspire,  
  
###### 11  
saying, “God has forsaken him; pursue him and seize him, for there is no one to rescue him.”  
  
###### 12  
Be not far from me, O God. Hurry, O my God, to help me.  
  
###### 13  
May the accusers of my soul be ashamed and consumed; may those who seek my harm be covered with scorn and disgrace.  
  
###### 14  
But I will always hope and will praise You more and more.  
  
###### 15  
My mouth will declare Your righteousness and Your salvation all day long, though I cannot know their full measure.  
  
###### 16  
I will enter in the strength of the Lord GOD; I will proclaim Your righteousness—Yours alone.  
  
###### 17  
O God, You have taught me from my youth, and to this day I proclaim Your marvelous deeds.  
  
###### 18  
Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, O God, until I proclaim Your power to the next generation, Your might to all who are to come.  
  
###### 19  
Your righteousness reaches to the heavens, O God, You who have done great things. Who, O God, is like You?  
  
###### 20  
Though You have shown me many troubles and misfortunes, You will revive me once again. Even from the depths of the earth You will bring me back up.  
  
###### 21  
You will increase my honor and comfort me once again.  
  
###### 22  
So I will praise You with the harp for Your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praise to You with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.  
  
###### 23  
When I sing praise to You my lips will shout for joy, along with my soul, which You have redeemed.  
  
###### 24  
My tongue will indeed proclaim Your righteousness all day long, for those who seek my harm are disgraced and confounded.
