For the choirmaster. A Maskil of David. After Doeg the Edomite went to Saul and told him, “David has gone to the house of Ahimelech.” Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man? The loving devotion of God endures all day long.  
  
###### 2  
Your tongue devises destruction like a sharpened razor, O worker of deceit.  
  
###### 3  
You love evil more than good, falsehood more than speaking truth. Selah  
  
###### 4  
You love every word that devours, O deceitful tongue.  
  
###### 5  
Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin; He will snatch you up and tear you away from your tent; He will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah

###### 9
