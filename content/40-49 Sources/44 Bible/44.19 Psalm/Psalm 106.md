###### 1  
Hallelujah! Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.  
  
###### 2  
Who can describe the mighty acts of the LORD or fully proclaim His praise?  
  
###### 3  
Blessed are those who uphold justice, who practice righteousness at all times.  
  
###### 4  
Remember me, O LORD, in Your favor to Your people; visit me with Your salvation,  
  
###### 5  
that I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones, and rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, and give glory with Your inheritance.  
  
###### 6  
We have sinned like our fathers; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.  
  
###### 7  
Our fathers in Egypt did not grasp Your wonders or remember Your abundant kindness; but they rebelled by the sea, there at the Red Sea.  
  
###### 8  
Yet He saved them for the sake of His name, to make His power known.  
  
###### 9  
He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; He led them through the depths as through a desert.  
  
###### 10  
He saved them from the hand that hated them; He redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.  
  
###### 11  
The waters covered their foes; not one of them remained.  
  
###### 12  
Then they believed His promises and sang His praise.  
  
###### 13  
Yet they soon forgot His works and failed to wait for His counsel.  
  
###### 14  
They craved intensely in the wilderness and tested God in the desert.  
  
###### 15  
So He granted their request, but sent a wasting disease upon them.  
  
###### 16  
In the camp they envied Moses, as well as Aaron, the holy one of the LORD.  
  
###### 17  
The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it covered the assembly of Abiram.  
  
###### 18  
Then fire blazed through their company; flames consumed the wicked.  
  
###### 19  
At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped a molten image.  
  
###### 20  
They exchanged their Glory for the image of a grass-eating ox.  
  
###### 21  
They forgot God their Savior, who did great things in Egypt,  
  
###### 22  
wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.  
  
###### 23  
So He said He would destroy them—had not Moses His chosen one stood before Him in the breach to divert His wrath from destroying them.  
  
###### 24  
They despised the pleasant land; they did not believe His promise.  
  
###### 25  
They grumbled in their tents and did not listen to the voice of the LORD.  
  
###### 26  
So He raised His hand and swore to cast them down in the wilderness,  
  
###### 27  
to disperse their offspring among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.  
  
###### 28  
They yoked themselves to Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods.  
  
###### 29  
So they provoked the LORD to anger with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them.  
  
###### 30  
But Phinehas stood and intervened, and the plague was restrained.  
  
###### 31  
It was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.  
  
###### 32  
At the waters of Meribah they angered the LORD, and trouble came to Moses because of them.  
  
###### 33  
For they rebelled against His Spirit, and Moses spoke rashly with his lips.  
  
###### 34  
They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them,  
  
###### 35  
but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs.  
  
###### 36  
They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.  
  
###### 37  
They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.  
  
###### 38  
They shed innocent blood—the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was polluted with blood.  
  
###### 39  
They defiled themselves by their actions and prostituted themselves by their deeds.  
  
###### 40  
So the anger of the LORD burned against His people, and He abhorred His own inheritance.  
  
###### 41  
He delivered them into the hand of the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them.  
  
###### 42  
Their enemies oppressed them, and subdued them under their hand.  
  
###### 43  
Many times He rescued them, but they were bent on rebellion and sank down in their iniquity.  
  
###### 44  
Nevertheless He heard their cry; He took note of their distress.  
  
###### 45  
And He remembered His covenant with them, and relented by the abundance of His loving devotion.  
  
###### 46  
He made them objects of compassion to all who held them captive.  
  
###### 47  
Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy name, that we may glory in Your praise.  
  
###### 48  
Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, “Amen!” Hallelujah!
