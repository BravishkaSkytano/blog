###### 1  
For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Death of the Son.” A Psalm of David. I will give thanks to the LORD with all my heart; I will recount all Your wonders.  
  
###### 2  
I will be glad and rejoice in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.  
  
###### 3  
When my enemies retreat, they stumble and perish before You.  
  
###### 4  
For You have upheld my just cause; You sit on Your throne judging righteously.  
  
###### 5  
You have rebuked the nations; You have destroyed the wicked; You have erased their name forever and ever.  
  
###### 6  
The enemy has come to eternal ruin, and You have uprooted their cities; the very memory of them has vanished.  
  
###### 7  
But the LORD abides forever; He has established His throne for judgment.  
  
###### 8  
He judges the world with justice; He governs the people with equity.  
  
###### 9  
The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.  
  
###### 10  
Those who know Your name trust in You, for You, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek You.  
  
###### 11  
Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; proclaim His deeds among the nations.  
  
###### 12  
For the Avenger of bloodshed remembers; He does not ignore the cry of the afflicted.  
  
###### 13  
Be merciful to me, O LORD; see how my enemies afflict me! Lift me up from the gates of death,  
  
###### 14  
that I may declare all Your praises—that within the gates of Daughter Zion I may rejoice in Your salvation.  
  
###### 15  
The nations have fallen into a pit of their making; their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.  
  
###### 16  
The LORD is known by the justice He brings; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands. Higgaion Selah  
  
###### 17  
The wicked will return to Sheol—all the nations who forget God.  
  
###### 18  
For the needy will not always be forgotten; nor the hope of the oppressed forever dashed.  
  
###### 19  
Rise up, O LORD, do not let man prevail; let the nations be judged in Your presence.  
  
###### 20  
Lay terror upon them, O LORD; let the nations know they are but men. Selah
