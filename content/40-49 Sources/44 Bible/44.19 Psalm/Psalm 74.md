###### 1  
A Maskil of Asaph. Why have You rejected us forever, O God? Why does Your anger smolder against the sheep of Your pasture?  
  
###### 2  
Remember Your congregation, which You purchased long ago and redeemed as the tribe of Your inheritance—Mount Zion where You dwell.  
  
###### 3  
Turn Your steps to the everlasting ruins, to everything in the sanctuary the enemy has destroyed.  
  
###### 4  
Your foes have roared within Your meeting place; they have unfurled their banners as signs,  
  
###### 5  
like men wielding axes in a thicket of trees  
  
###### 6  
and smashing all the carvings with hatchets and picks.  
  
###### 7  
They have burned Your sanctuary to the ground; they have defiled the dwelling place of Your Name.  
  
###### 8  
They said in their hearts, “We will crush them completely.” They burned down every place where God met us in the land.  
  
###### 9  
There are no signs for us to see. There is no longer any prophet. And none of us knows how long this will last.  
  
###### 10  
How long, O God, will the enemy taunt You? Will the foe revile Your name forever?  
  
###### 11  
Why do You withdraw Your strong right hand? Stretch it out to destroy them!  
  
###### 12  
Yet God is my King from ancient times, working salvation on the earth.  
  
###### 13  
You divided the sea by Your strength; You smashed the heads of the dragons of the sea;  
  
###### 14  
You crushed the heads of Leviathan; You fed him to the creatures of the desert.  
  
###### 15  
You broke open the fountain and the flood; You dried up the ever-flowing rivers.  
  
###### 16  
The day is Yours, and also the night; You established the moon and the sun.  
  
###### 17  
You set all the boundaries of the earth; You made the summer and winter.  
  
###### 18  
Remember how the enemy has mocked You, O LORD, how a foolish people has spurned Your name.  
  
###### 19  
Do not deliver the soul of Your dove to beasts; do not forget the lives of Your afflicted forever.  
  
###### 20  
Consider Your covenant, for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.  
  
###### 21  
Do not let the oppressed retreat in shame; may the poor and needy praise Your name.  
  
###### 22  
Rise up, O God; defend Your cause! Remember how the fool mocks You all day long.  
  
###### 23  
Do not disregard the clamor of Your adversaries, the uproar of Your enemies that ascends continually.
