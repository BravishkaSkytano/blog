###### 1  
A song. A Psalm of Asaph. O God, be not silent; be not speechless; be not still, O God.  
  
###### 2  
See how Your enemies rage, how Your foes have reared their heads.  
  
###### 3  
With cunning they scheme against Your people and conspire against those You cherish,  
  
###### 4  
saying, “Come, let us erase them as a nation; may the name of Israel be remembered no more.”  
  
###### 5  
For with one mind they plot together, they form an alliance against You—  
  
###### 6  
the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagrites,  
  
###### 7  
of Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, of Philistia with the people of Tyre.  
  
###### 8  
Even Assyria has joined them, lending strength to the sons of Lot. Selah  
  
###### 9  
Do to them as You did to Midian, as to Sisera and Jabin at the River Kishon,  
  
###### 10  
who perished at Endor and became like dung on the ground.  
  
###### 11  
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, and all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,  
  
###### 12  
who said, “Let us possess for ourselves the pastures of God.”  
  
###### 13  
Make them like tumbleweed, O my God, like chaff before the wind.  
  
###### 14  
As fire consumes a forest, as a flame sets the mountains ablaze,  
  
###### 15  
so pursue them with Your tempest, and terrify them with Your storm.  
  
###### 16  
Cover their faces with shame, that they may seek Your name, O LORD.  
  
###### 17  
May they be ever ashamed and terrified; may they perish in disgrace.  
  
###### 18  
May they know that You alone, whose name is the LORD, are Most High over all the earth.
