May He send you help from the sanctuary and sustain you from Zion.

May He give you the desires of your heart and make all your plans succeed.  
  
###### 5  
May we shout for joy at your victory and raise a banner in the name of our God. May the LORD grant all your petitions.  
  
###### 6  
Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed; He answers him from His holy heaven with the saving power of His right hand.  
  
###### 7  
Some trust in chariots and others in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.
