###### 1  
Of David. Do not fret over those who do evil; do not envy those who do wrong.  
  
###### 2  
For they wither quickly like grass and wilt like tender plants.  
  
###### 3  
Trust in the LORD and do good; dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness.  
  
###### 4  
Delight yourself in the LORD, and He will give you the desires of your heart.  
  
###### 5  
Commit your way to the LORD; trust in Him, and He will do it.  
  
###### 6  
He will bring forth your righteousness like the dawn, your justice like the noonday sun.  
  
###### 7  
Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for Him; do not fret when men prosper in their ways, when they carry out wicked schemes.  
  
###### 8  
Refrain from anger and abandon wrath; do not fret—it can only bring harm.  
  
###### 9  
For the evildoers will be cut off, but those who hope in the LORD will inherit the land.  
  
###### 10  
Yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found.  
  
###### 11  
But the meek will inherit the land and delight in abundant prosperity.  
  
###### 12  
The wicked scheme against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them,  
  
###### 13  
but the Lord laughs, seeing that their day is coming.  
  
###### 14  
The wicked have drawn the sword and bent the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose ways are upright.  
  
###### 15  
But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken.  
  
###### 16  
Better is the little of the righteous than the abundance of many who are wicked.  
  
###### 17  
For the arms of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous.  
  
###### 18  
The LORD knows the days of the blameless, and their inheritance will last forever.  
  
###### 19  
In the time of evil they will not be ashamed, and in the days of famine they will be satisfied.  
  
###### 20  
But the wicked and enemies of the LORD will perish like the glory of the fields. They will vanish; like smoke they will fade away.  
  
###### 21  
The wicked borrow and do not repay, but the righteous are gracious and giving.  
  
###### 22  
Surely those He blesses will inherit the land, but the cursed will be destroyed.  
  
###### 23  
The steps of a man are ordered by the LORD who takes delight in his journey.  
  
###### 24  
Though he falls, he will not be overwhelmed, for the LORD is holding his hand.  
  
###### 25  
I once was young and now am old, yet never have I seen the righteous abandoned or their children begging for bread.  
  
###### 26  
They are ever generous and quick to lend, and their children are a blessing.  
  
###### 27  
Turn away from evil and do good, so that you will abide forever.  
  
###### 28  
For the LORD loves justice and will not forsake His saints. They are preserved forever, but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off.  
  
###### 29  
The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever.  
  
###### 30  
The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice.  
  
###### 31  
The law of his God is in his heart; his steps do not falter.  
  
###### 32  
Though the wicked lie in wait for the righteous, and seek to slay them,  
  
###### 33  
the LORD will not leave them in their power or let them be condemned under judgment.  
  
###### 34  
Wait for the LORD and keep His way, and He will raise you up to inherit the land. When the wicked are cut off, you will see it.  
  
###### 35  
I have seen a wicked, ruthless man flourishing like a well-rooted native tree,  
  
###### 36  
yet he passed away and was no more; though I searched, he could not be found.  
  
###### 37  
Consider the blameless and observe the upright, for posterity awaits the man of peace.  
  
###### 38  
But the transgressors will all be destroyed; the future of the wicked will be cut off.  
  
###### 39  
The salvation of the righteous is from the LORD; He is their stronghold in time of trouble.  
  
###### 40  
The LORD helps and delivers them; He rescues and saves them from the wicked, because they take refuge in Him.
