###### 1  
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. You showed favor to Your land, O LORD; You restored Jacob from captivity.  
  
###### 2  
You forgave the iniquity of Your people; You covered all their sin. Selah  
  
###### 3  
You withheld all Your fury; You turned from Your burning anger.  
  
###### 4  
Restore us, O God of our salvation, and put away Your displeasure toward us.  
  
###### 5  
Will You be angry with us forever? Will You draw out Your anger to all generations?  
  
###### 6  
Will You not revive us again, that Your people may rejoice in You?  
  
###### 7  
Show us Your loving devotion, O LORD, and grant us Your salvation.  
  
###### 8  
I will listen to what God the LORD will say; for He will surely speak peace to His people and His saints; He will not let them return to folly.  
  
###### 9  
Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him, that His glory may dwell in our land.  
  
###### 10  
Loving devotion and faithfulness have joined together; righteousness and peace have kissed.  
  
###### 11  
Faithfulness sprouts from the earth, and righteousness looks down from heaven.  
  
###### 12  
The LORD will indeed provide what is good, and our land will yield its increase.  
  
###### 13  
Righteousness will go before Him to prepare the way for His steps.
