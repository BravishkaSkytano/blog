###### 1  
For the choirmaster. A Maskil of the sons of Korah. As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul longs after You, O God.  
  
###### 2  
My soul thirsts for God, the living God. When shall I come and appear in God’s presence?  
  
###### 3  
My tears have been my food both day and night, while men ask me all day long, “Where is your God?”  
  
###### 4  
These things come to mind as I pour out my soul: how I walked with the multitude, leading the procession to the house of God with shouts of joy and praise.  
  
###### 5  
Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why the unease within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise Him for the salvation of His presence.  
  
###### 6  
O my God, my soul despairs within me. Therefore I remember You from the land of Jordan and the peaks of Hermon—even from Mount Mizar.  
  
###### 7  
Deep calls to deep in the roar of Your waterfalls; all Your breakers and waves have rolled over me.  
  
###### 8  
The LORD decrees His loving devotion by day, and at night His song is with me as a prayer to the God of my life.  
  
###### 9  
I say to God my Rock, “Why have You forgotten me? Why must I walk in sorrow because of the enemy’s oppression?”  
  
###### 10  
Like the crushing of my bones, my enemies taunt me, while they say to me all day long, “Where is your God?”  
  
###### 11  
Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why the unease within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise Him, my Savior and my God.
