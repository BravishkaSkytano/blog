###### 1  
For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Maskil of David. When the Ziphites went to Saul and said, “Is David not hiding among us?” Save me, O God, by Your name, and vindicate me by Your might!  
  
###### 2  
Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth.  
  
###### 3  
For strangers rise up against me, and ruthless men seek my life—men with no regard for God. Selah  
  
###### 4  
Surely God is my helper; the Lord is the sustainer of my soul.  
  
###### 5  
He will reward my enemies with evil. In Your faithfulness, destroy them.  
  
###### 6  
Freely I will sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, O LORD, for it is good.  
  
###### 7  
For He has delivered me from every trouble, and my eyes have stared down my foes.
