###### 1  
A song of ascents. Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion. It cannot be moved; it abides forever.  
  
###### 2  
As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds His people, both now and forevermore.  
  
###### 3  
For the scepter of the wicked will not rest upon the land allotted to the righteous, so that the righteous will not put forth their hands to injustice.  
  
###### 4  
Do good, O LORD, to those who are good, and to the upright in heart.  
  
###### 5  
But those who turn to crooked ways the LORD will banish with the evildoers. Peace be upon Israel.
