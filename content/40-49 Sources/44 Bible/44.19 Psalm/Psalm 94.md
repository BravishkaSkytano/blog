###### 1  
O LORD, God of vengeance, O God of vengeance, shine forth.  
  
###### 2  
Rise up, O Judge of the earth; render a reward to the proud.  
  
###### 3  
How long will the wicked, O LORD, how long will the wicked exult?  
  
###### 4  
They pour out arrogant words; all workers of iniquity boast.  
  
###### 5  
They crush Your people, O LORD; they oppress Your heritage.  
  
###### 6  
They kill the widow and the foreigner; they murder the fatherless.  
  
###### 7  
They say, “The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob pays no heed.”  
  
###### 8  
Take notice, O senseless among the people! O fools, when will you be wise?  
  
###### 9  
He who affixed the ear, can He not hear? He who formed the eye, can He not see?  
  
###### 10  
He who admonishes the nations, does He not discipline? He who teaches man, does He lack knowledge?  
  
###### 11  
The LORD knows the thoughts of man, that they are futile.  
  
###### 12  
Blessed is the man You discipline, O LORD, and teach from Your law,  
  
###### 13  
to grant him relief from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked.  
  
###### 14  
For the LORD will not forsake His people; He will never abandon His heritage.  
  
###### 15  
Surely judgment will again be righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it.  
  
###### 16  
Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will stand for me against the workers of iniquity?  
  
###### 17  
Unless the LORD had been my helper, I would soon have dwelt in the abode of silence.  
  
###### 18  
If I say, “My foot is slipping,” Your loving devotion, O LORD, supports me.  
  
###### 19  
When anxiety overwhelms me, Your consolation delights my soul.  
  
###### 20  
Can a corrupt throne be Your ally—one devising mischief by decree?  
  
###### 21  
They band together against the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.  
  
###### 22  
But the LORD has been my stronghold, and my God is my rock of refuge.  
  
###### 23  
He will bring upon them their own iniquity and destroy them for their wickedness. The LORD our God will destroy them.
