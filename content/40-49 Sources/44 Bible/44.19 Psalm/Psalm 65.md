###### 1  
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. A song. Praise awaits You, O God, in Zion; to You our vows will be fulfilled.  
  
###### 2  
O You who listen to prayer, all people will come to You.  
  
###### 3  
When iniquities prevail against me, You atone for our transgressions.  
  
###### 4  
Blessed is the one You choose and bring near to dwell in Your courts! We are filled with the goodness of Your house, the holiness of Your temple.  
  
###### 5  
With awesome deeds of righteousness You answer us, O God of our salvation, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas.  
  
###### 6  
You formed the mountains by Your power, having girded Yourself with might.  
  
###### 7  
You stilled the roaring of the seas, the pounding of their waves, and the tumult of the nations.  
  
###### 8  
Those who live far away fear Your wonders; You make the dawn and sunset shout for joy.  
  
###### 9  
You attend to the earth and water it; with abundance You enrich it. The streams of God are full of water, for You prepare our grain by providing for the earth.  
  
###### 10  
You soak its furrows and level its ridges; You soften it with showers and bless its growth.  
  
###### 11  
You crown the year with Your bounty, and Your paths overflow with plenty.  
  
###### 12  
The pastures of the wilderness overflow; the hills are robed with joy.  
  
###### 13  
The pastures are clothed with flocks, and the valleys are decked with grain. They shout in triumph; indeed, they sing.
