###### 1  
For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Doe of the Dawn.” A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? Why are You so far from saving me, so far from my words of groaning?  
  
###### 2  
I cry out by day, O my God, but You do not answer, and by night, but I have no rest.  
  
###### 3  
Yet You are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.  
  
###### 4  
In You our fathers trusted; they trusted and You delivered them.  
  
###### 5  
They cried out to You and were set free; they trusted in You and were not disappointed.  
  
###### 6  
But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by men and despised by the people.  
  
###### 7  
All who see me mock me; they sneer and shake their heads:  
  
###### 8  
“He trusts in the LORD, let the LORD deliver him; let the LORD rescue him, since He delights in him.”  
  
###### 9  
Yet You brought me forth from the womb; You made me secure at my mother’s breast.  
  
###### 10  
From birth I was cast upon You; from my mother’s womb You have been my God.  
  
###### 11  
Be not far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.  
  
###### 12  
Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.  
  
###### 13  
They open their jaws against me like lions that roar and maul.  
  
###### 14  
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are disjointed. My heart is like wax; it melts away within me.  
  
###### 15  
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. You lay me in the dust of death.  
  
###### 16  
For dogs surround me; a band of evil men encircles me; they have pierced my hands and feet.  
  
###### 17  
I can count all my bones; they stare and gloat over me.  
  
###### 18  
They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.  
  
###### 19  
But You, O LORD, be not far off; O my Strength, come quickly to help me.  
  
###### 20  
Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power of wild dogs.  
  
###### 21  
Save me from the mouth of the lion; at the horns of the wild oxen You have answered me!  
  
###### 22  
I will proclaim Your name to my brothers; I will praise You in the assembly.  
  
###### 23  
You who fear the LORD, praise Him! All descendants of Jacob, honor Him! All offspring of Israel, revere Him!  
  
###### 24  
For He has not despised or detested the torment of the afflicted. He has not hidden His face from him, but has attended to his cry for help.  
  
###### 25  
My praise for You resounds in the great assembly; I will fulfill my vows before those who fear You.  
  
###### 26  
The poor will eat and be satisfied; those who seek the LORD will praise Him. May your hearts live forever!  
  
###### 27  
All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the LORD. All the families of the nations will bow down before Him.  
  
###### 28  
For dominion belongs to the LORD and He rules over the nations.  
  
###### 29  
All the rich of the earth will feast and worship; all who go down to the dust will kneel before Him—even those unable to preserve their lives.  
  
###### 30  
Posterity will serve Him; they will declare the Lord to a new generation.  
  
###### 31  
They will come and proclaim His righteousness to a people yet unborn—all that He has done.
