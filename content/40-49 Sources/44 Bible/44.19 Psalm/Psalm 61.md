###### 3  
For You have been my refuge, a tower of strength against the enemy.  
  
###### 4  
Let me dwell in Your tent forever and take refuge in the shelter of Your wings. Selah

For You have heard my vows, O God; You have given me the inheritance reserved for those who fear Your name.

Increase the days of the king’s life; may his years span many generations.

May he sit enthroned in God’s presence forever; appoint Your loving devotion and Your faithfulness to guard him.

Then I will ever sing praise to Your name and fulfill my vows day by day.
