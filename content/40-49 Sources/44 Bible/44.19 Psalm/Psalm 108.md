###### 1  
A song. A Psalm of David. My heart is steadfast, O God; I will sing and make music with all my being.  
  
###### 2  
Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.  
  
###### 3  
I will praise You, O LORD, among the nations; I will sing Your praises among the peoples.  
  
###### 4  
For Your loving devotion extends beyond the heavens, and Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.  
  
###### 5  
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; may Your glory cover all the earth.  
  
###### 6  
Respond and save us with Your right hand, that Your beloved may be delivered.  
  
###### 7  
God has spoken from His sanctuary: “I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem and apportion the Valley of Succoth.  
  
###### 8  
Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim is My helmet, Judah is My scepter.  
  
###### 9  
Moab is My washbasin; upon Edom I toss My sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph.”  
  
###### 10  
Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?  
  
###### 11  
Have You not rejected us, O God? Will You no longer march out, O God, with our armies?  
  
###### 12  
Give us aid against the enemy, for the help of man is worthless.  
  
###### 13  
With God we will perform with valor, and He will trample our enemies.
