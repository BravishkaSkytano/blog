###### 1  
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. O God of my praise, be not silent.  
  
###### 2  
For wicked and deceitful mouths open against me; they speak against me with lying tongues.  
  
###### 3  
They surround me with hateful words and attack me without cause.  
  
###### 4  
In return for my love they accuse me, but I am a man of prayer.  
  
###### 5  
They repay me evil for good, and hatred for my love.  
  
###### 6  
Set over him a wicked man; let an accuser stand at his right hand.  
  
###### 7  
When he is tried, let him be found guilty, and may his prayer be regarded as sin.  
  
###### 8  
May his days be few; may another take his position.  
  
###### 9  
May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.  
  
###### 10  
May his children wander as beggars, seeking sustenance far from their ruined homes.  
  
###### 11  
May the creditor seize all he owns, and strangers plunder the fruits of his labor.  
  
###### 12  
May there be no one to extend kindness to him, and no one to favor his fatherless children.  
  
###### 13  
May his descendants be cut off; may their name be blotted out from the next generation.  
  
###### 14  
May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD, and the sin of his mother never be blotted out.  
  
###### 15  
May their sins always remain before the LORD, that He may cut off their memory from the earth.  
  
###### 16  
For he never thought to show kindness, but pursued the poor and needy and brokenhearted, even to their death.  
  
###### 17  
The cursing that he loved, may it fall on him; the blessing in which he refused to delight, may it be far from him.  
  
###### 18  
The cursing that he wore like a coat, may it soak into his body like water, and into his bones like oil.  
  
###### 19  
May it be like a robe wrapped about him, like a belt tied forever around him.  
  
###### 20  
May this be the LORD’s reward to my accusers, to those who speak evil against me.  
  
###### 21  
But You, O GOD, the Lord, deal kindly with me for the sake of Your name; deliver me by the goodness of Your loving devotion.  
  
###### 22  
For I am poor and needy; my heart is wounded within me.  
  
###### 23  
I am fading away like a lengthening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust.  
  
###### 24  
My knees are weak from fasting, and my body grows lean and gaunt.  
  
###### 25  
I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they shake their heads.  
  
###### 26  
Help me, O LORD my God; save me according to Your loving devotion.  
  
###### 27  
Let them know that this is Your hand, that You, O LORD, have done it.  
  
###### 28  
Though they curse, You will bless. When they rise up, they will be put to shame, but Your servant will rejoice.  
  
###### 29  
May my accusers be clothed with disgrace; may they wear their shame like a robe.  
  
###### 30  
With my mouth I will thank the LORD profusely; I will praise Him in the presence of many.  
  
###### 31  
For He stands at the right hand of the needy one, to save him from the condemners of his soul.
