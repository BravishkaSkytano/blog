###### 1  
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. O LORD, You have searched me and known me.  
  
###### 2  
You know when I sit and when I rise; You understand my thoughts from afar.  
  
###### 3  
You search out my path and my lying down; You are aware of all my ways.  
  
###### 4  
Even before a word is on my tongue, You know all about it, O LORD.  
  
###### 5  
You hem me in behind and before; You have laid Your hand upon me.  
  
###### 6  
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain.  
  
###### 7  
Where can I go to escape Your Spirit? Where can I flee from Your presence?  
  
###### 8  
If I ascend to the heavens, You are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, You are there.  
  
###### 9  
If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle by the farthest sea,  
  
###### 10  
even there Your hand will guide me; Your right hand will hold me fast.  
  
###### 11  
If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me, and the light become night around me”—  
  
###### 12  
even the darkness is not dark to You, but the night shines like the day, for darkness is as light to You.  
  
###### 13  
For You formed my inmost being; You knit me together in my mother’s womb.  
  
###### 14  
I praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Marvelous are Your works, and I know this very well.  
  
###### 15  
My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in secret, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.  
  
###### 16  
Your eyes saw my unformed body; all my days were written in Your book and ordained for me before one of them came to be.  
  
###### 17  
How precious to me are Your thoughts, O God, how vast is their sum!  
  
###### 18  
If I were to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand; and when I awake, I am still with You.  
  
###### 19  
O God, that You would slay the wicked—away from me, you bloodthirsty men—  
  
###### 20  
who speak of You deceitfully; Your enemies take Your name in vain.  
  
###### 21  
Do I not hate those who hate You, O LORD, and detest those who rise against You?  
  
###### 22  
I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them as my enemies.  
  
###### 23  
Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my concerns.  
  
###### 24  
See if there is any offensive way in me; lead me in the way everlasting.
