###### 1  
Bless the LORD, O my soul! O LORD my God, You are very great; You are clothed with splendor and majesty.  
  
###### 2  
He wraps Himself in light as with a garment; He stretches out the heavens like a tent,  
  
###### 3  
laying the beams of His chambers in the waters above, making the clouds His chariot, walking on the wings of the wind.  
  
###### 4  
He makes the winds His messengers, flames of fire His servants.  
  
###### 5  
He set the earth on its foundations, never to be moved.  
  
###### 6  
You covered it with the deep like a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.  
  
###### 7  
At Your rebuke the waters fled; at the sound of Your thunder they hurried away—  
  
###### 8  
the mountains rose and the valleys sank to the place You assigned for them—  
  
###### 9  
You set a boundary they cannot cross, that they may never again cover the earth.  
  
###### 10  
He sends forth springs in the valleys; they flow between the mountains.  
  
###### 11  
They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.  
  
###### 12  
The birds of the air nest beside the springs; they sing among the branches.  
  
###### 13  
He waters the mountains from His chambers; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of His works.  
  
###### 14  
He makes the grass grow for the livestock and provides crops for man to cultivate, bringing forth food from the earth:  
  
###### 15  
wine that gladdens the heart of man, oil that makes his face to shine, and bread that sustains his heart.  
  
###### 16  
The trees of the LORD have their fill, the cedars of Lebanon that He planted,  
  
###### 17  
where the birds build their nests; the stork makes her home in the cypresses.  
  
###### 18  
The high mountains are for the wild goats, the cliffs a refuge for the rock badgers.  
  
###### 19  
He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows when to set.  
  
###### 20  
You bring darkness, and it becomes night, when all the beasts of the forest prowl.  
  
###### 21  
The young lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.  
  
###### 22  
The sun rises, and they withdraw; they lie down in their dens.  
  
###### 23  
Man goes forth to his work and to his labor until evening.  
  
###### 24  
How many are Your works, O LORD! In wisdom You have made them all; the earth is full of Your creatures.  
  
###### 25  
Here is the sea, vast and wide, teeming with creatures beyond number, living things both great and small.  
  
###### 26  
There the ships pass, and Leviathan, which You formed to frolic there.  
  
###### 27  
All creatures look to You to give them their food in due season.  
  
###### 28  
When You give it to them, they gather it up; when You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good things.  
  
###### 29  
When You hide Your face, they are terrified; when You take away their breath, they die and return to dust.  
  
###### 30  
When You send Your Spirit, they are created, and You renew the face of the earth.  
  
###### 31  
May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in His works.  
  
###### 32  
He looks on the earth, and it trembles; He touches the mountains, and they smolder.  
  
###### 33  
I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.  
  
###### 34  
May my meditation be pleasing to Him, for I rejoice in the LORD.  
  
###### 35  
May sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Hallelujah!
