###### 1  
A prayer of David. Incline Your ear, O LORD, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.  
  
###### 2  
Preserve my soul, for I am godly. You are my God; save Your servant who trusts in You.  
  
###### 3  
Be merciful to me, O Lord, for I call to You all day long.  
  
###### 4  
Bring joy to Your servant, for to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.  
  
###### 5  
For You, O Lord, are kind and forgiving, rich in loving devotion to all who call on You.  
  
###### 6  
Hear my prayer, O LORD, and attend to my plea for mercy.  
  
###### 7  
In the day of my distress I call on You, because You answer me.  
  
###### 8  
O Lord, there is none like You among the gods, nor any works like Yours.  
  
###### 9  
All the nations You have made will come and bow before You, O Lord, and they will glorify Your name.  
  
###### 10  
For You are great and perform wonders; You alone are God.  
  
###### 11  
Teach me Your way, O LORD, that I may walk in Your truth. Give me an undivided heart, that I may fear Your name.  
  
###### 12  
I will praise You, O Lord my God, with all my heart; I will glorify Your name forever.  
  
###### 13  
For great is Your loving devotion to me; You have delivered me from the depths of Sheol.  
  
###### 14  
The arrogant rise against me, O God; a band of ruthless men seeks my life, with no regard for You.  
  
###### 15  
But You, O Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion and faithfulness.  
  
###### 16  
Turn to me and have mercy; grant Your strength to Your servant; save the son of Your maidservant.  
  
###### 17  
Show me a sign of Your goodness, that my enemies may see and be ashamed; for You, O LORD, have helped me and comforted me.
