###### 1  
A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing of the loving devotion of the LORD forever; with my mouth I will proclaim Your faithfulness to all generations.  
  
###### 2  
For I have said, “Loving devotion is built up forever; in the heavens You establish Your faithfulness.”  
  
###### 3  
You said, “I have made a covenant with My chosen one, I have sworn to David My servant:  
  
###### 4  
‘I will establish your offspring forever and build up your throne for all generations.’” Selah  
  
###### 5  
The heavens praise Your wonders, O LORD—Your faithfulness as well—in the assembly of the holy ones.  
  
###### 6  
For who in the skies can compare with the LORD? Who among the heavenly beings is like the LORD?  
  
###### 7  
In the council of the holy ones, God is greatly feared, and awesome above all who surround Him.  
  
###### 8  
O LORD God of Hosts, who is like You? O mighty LORD, Your faithfulness surrounds You.  
  
###### 9  
You rule the raging sea; when its waves mount up, You still them.  
  
###### 10  
You crushed Rahab like a carcass; You scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm.  
  
###### 11  
The heavens are Yours, and also the earth. The earth and its fullness You founded.  
  
###### 12  
North and south You created; Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at Your name.  
  
###### 13  
Mighty is Your arm; strong is Your hand. Your right hand is exalted.  
  
###### 14  
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; loving devotion and faithfulness go before You.  
  
###### 15  
Blessed are those who know the joyful sound, who walk, O LORD, in the light of Your presence.  
  
###### 16  
They rejoice in Your name all day long, and in Your righteousness they exult.  
  
###### 17  
For You are the glory of their strength, and by Your favor our horn is exalted.  
  
###### 18  
Surely our shield belongs to the LORD, and our king to the Holy One of Israel.  
  
###### 19  
You once spoke in a vision; to Your godly ones You said, “I have bestowed help on a warrior; I have exalted one chosen from the people.  
  
###### 20  
I have found My servant David; with My sacred oil I have anointed him.  
  
###### 21  
My hand will sustain him; surely My arm will strengthen him.  
  
###### 22  
No enemy will exact tribute; no wicked man will oppress him.  
  
###### 23  
I will crush his foes before him and strike down those who hate him.  
  
###### 24  
My faithfulness and loving devotion will be with him, and through My name his horn will be exalted.  
  
###### 25  
I will set his hand over the sea, and his right hand upon the rivers.  
  
###### 26  
He will call to Me, ‘You are my Father, my God, the Rock of my salvation.’  
  
###### 27  
I will indeed appoint him as My firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.  
  
###### 28  
I will forever preserve My loving devotion for him, and My covenant with him will stand fast.  
  
###### 29  
I will establish his line forever, his throne as long as the heavens endure.  
  
###### 30  
If his sons forsake My law and do not walk in My judgments,  
  
###### 31  
if they violate My statutes and fail to keep My commandments,  
  
###### 32  
I will attend to their transgression with the rod, and to their iniquity with stripes.  
  
###### 33  
But I will not withdraw My loving devotion from him, nor ever betray My faithfulness.  
  
###### 34  
I will not violate My covenant or alter the utterance of My lips.  
  
###### 35  
Once and for all I have sworn by My holiness—I will not lie to David—  
  
###### 36  
his offspring shall endure forever, and his throne before Me like the sun,  
  
###### 37  
like the moon, established forever, a faithful witness in the sky.” Selah  
  
###### 38  
Now, however, You have spurned and rejected him; You are enraged by Your anointed one.  
  
###### 39  
You have renounced the covenant with Your servant and sullied his crown in the dust.  
  
###### 40  
You have broken down all his walls; You have reduced his strongholds to rubble.  
  
###### 41  
All who pass by plunder him; he has become a reproach to his neighbors.  
  
###### 42  
You have exalted the right hand of his foes; You have made all his enemies rejoice.  
  
###### 43  
You have bent the edge of his sword and have not sustained him in battle.  
  
###### 44  
You have ended his splendor and cast his throne to the ground.  
  
###### 45  
You have cut short the days of his youth; You have covered him with shame. Selah  
  
###### 46  
How long, O LORD? Will You hide Yourself forever? Will Your wrath keep burning like fire?  
  
###### 47  
Remember the briefness of my lifespan! For what futility You have created all men!  
  
###### 48  
What man can live and never see death? Can he deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah  
  
###### 49  
Where, O Lord, is Your loving devotion of old, which You faithfully swore to David?  
  
###### 50  
Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Your servants, which I bear in my heart from so many people—  
  
###### 51  
how Your enemies have taunted, O LORD, and have mocked every step of Your anointed one!  
  
###### 52  
Blessed be the LORD forever! Amen and amen.
