###### 1  
A Psalm of David. O LORD, hear my prayer. In Your faithfulness, give ear to my plea; in Your righteousness, answer me.  
  
###### 2  
Do not bring Your servant into judgment, for no one alive is righteous before You.  
  
###### 3  
For the enemy has pursued my soul, crushing my life to the ground, making me dwell in darkness like those long since dead.  
  
###### 4  
My spirit grows faint within me; my heart is dismayed inside me.  
  
###### 5  
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Your works; I consider the work of Your hands.  
  
###### 6  
I stretch out my hands to You; my soul thirsts for You like a parched land. Selah  
  
###### 7  
Answer me quickly, O LORD; my spirit fails. Do not hide Your face from me, or I will be like those who descend to the Pit.  
  
###### 8  
Let me hear Your loving devotion in the morning, for I have put my trust in You. Teach me the way I should walk, for to You I lift up my soul.  
  
###### 9  
Deliver me from my enemies, O LORD; I flee to You for refuge.  
  
###### 10  
Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God. May Your good Spirit lead me on level ground.  
  
###### 11  
For the sake of Your name, O LORD, revive me. In Your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble.  
  
###### 12  
And in Your loving devotion, cut off my enemies. Destroy all who afflict me, for I am Your servant.
