###### 1  
A Psalm of David, for remembrance. O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger or discipline me in Your wrath.  
  
###### 2  
For Your arrows have pierced me deeply, and Your hand has pressed down on me.  
  
###### 3  
There is no soundness in my body because of Your anger; there is no rest in my bones because of my sin.  
  
###### 4  
For my iniquities have overwhelmed me; they are a burden too heavy to bear.  
  
###### 5  
My wounds are foul and festering because of my sinful folly.  
  
###### 6  
I am bent and brought low; all day long I go about mourning.  
  
###### 7  
For my loins are full of burning pain, and no soundness remains in my body.  
  
###### 8  
I am numb and badly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart.  
  
###### 9  
O Lord, my every desire is before You; my groaning is not hidden from You.  
  
###### 10  
My heart pounds, my strength fails, and even the light of my eyes has faded.  
  
###### 11  
My beloved and friends shun my disease, and my kinsmen stand at a distance.  
  
###### 12  
Those who seek my life lay snares; those who wish me harm speak destruction, plotting deceit all day long.  
  
###### 13  
But like a deaf man, I do not hear; and like a mute man, I do not open my mouth.  
  
###### 14  
I am like a man who cannot hear, whose mouth offers no reply.  
  
###### 15  
I wait for You, O LORD; You will answer, O Lord my God.  
  
###### 16  
For I said, “Let them not gloat over me—those who taunt me when my foot slips.”  
  
###### 17  
For I am ready to fall, and my pain is ever with me.  
  
###### 18  
Yes, I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin.  
  
###### 19  
Many are my enemies without cause, and many hate me without reason.  
  
###### 20  
Those who repay my good with evil attack me for pursuing the good.  
  
###### 21  
Do not forsake me, O LORD; be not far from me, O my God.  
  
###### 22  
Come quickly to help me, O Lord my Savior.
