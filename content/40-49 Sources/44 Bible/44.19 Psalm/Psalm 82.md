###### 1  
A Psalm of Asaph. God presides in the divine assembly; He renders judgment among the gods:  
  
###### 2  
“How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Selah  
  
###### 3  
Defend the cause of the weak and fatherless; uphold the rights of the afflicted and oppressed.  
  
###### 4  
Rescue the weak and needy; save them from the hand of the wicked.  
  
###### 5  
They do not know or understand; they wander in the darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.  
  
###### 6  
I have said, ‘You are gods; you are all sons of the Most High.’  
  
###### 7  
But like mortals you will die, and like rulers you will fall.”  
  
###### 8  
Arise, O God, judge the earth, for all the nations are Your inheritance.
