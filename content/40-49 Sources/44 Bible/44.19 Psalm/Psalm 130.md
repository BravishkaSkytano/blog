###### 1  
A song of ascents. Out of the depths I cry to You, O LORD!  
  
###### 2  
O Lord, hear my voice; let Your ears be attentive to my plea for mercy.  
  
###### 3  
If You, O LORD, kept track of iniquities, then who, O Lord, could stand?  
  
###### 4  
But with You there is forgiveness, so that You may be feared.  
  
###### 5  
I wait for the LORD; my soul does wait, and in His word I put my hope.  
  
###### 6  
My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning—more than watchmen wait for the morning.  
  
###### 7  
O Israel, put your hope in the LORD, for with the LORD is loving devotion, and with Him is redemption in abundance.  
  
###### 8  
And He will redeem Israel from all iniquity.
