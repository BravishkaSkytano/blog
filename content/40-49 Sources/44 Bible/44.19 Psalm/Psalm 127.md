###### 1  
A song of ascents. Of Solomon. Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders labor in vain; unless the LORD protects the city, its watchmen stand guard in vain.  
  
###### 2  
In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for bread to eat—for He gives sleep to His beloved.  
  
###### 3  
Children are indeed a heritage from the LORD, and the fruit of the womb is His reward.  
  
###### 4  
Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are children born in one’s youth.  
  
###### 5  
Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. He will not be put to shame when he confronts the enemies at the gate.
