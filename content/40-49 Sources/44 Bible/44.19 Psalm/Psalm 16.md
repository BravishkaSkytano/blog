###### 1  
A Miktam of David. Preserve me, O God, for in You I take refuge.  
  
###### 2  
I said to the LORD, “You are my Lord; apart from You I have no good thing.”  
  
###### 3  
As for the saints in the land, they are the excellence in whom all my delight resides.  
  
###### 4  
Sorrows will multiply to those who chase other gods. I will not pour out their libations of blood, or speak their names with my lips.  
  
###### 5  
The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup; You have made my lot secure.  
  
###### 6  
The lines of my boundary have fallen in pleasant places; surely my inheritance is delightful.  
  
###### 7  
I will bless the LORD who counsels me; even at night my conscience instructs me.  
  
###### 8  
I have set the LORD always before me. Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.  
  
###### 9  
Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will dwell securely.  
  
###### 10  
For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol, nor will You let Your Holy One see decay.  
  
###### 11  
You have made known to me the path of life; You will fill me with joy in Your presence, with eternal pleasures at Your right hand.
