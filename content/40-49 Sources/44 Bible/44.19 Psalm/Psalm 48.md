###### 1  
A song. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, His holy mountain.  
  
###### 2  
Beautiful in loftiness, the joy of all the earth, like the peaks of Zaphon is Mount Zion, the city of the great King.  
  
###### 3  
God is in her citadels; He has shown Himself to be a fortress.  
  
###### 4  
For behold, the kings assembled; they all advanced together.  
  
###### 5  
They saw and were astounded; they fled in terror.  
  
###### 6  
Trembling seized them there, anguish like a woman in labor.  
  
###### 7  
With a wind from the east You wrecked the ships of Tarshish.  
  
###### 8  
As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of the LORD of Hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish her forever. Selah  
  
###### 9  
Within Your temple, O God, we contemplate Your loving devotion.  
  
###### 10  
Your name, O God, like Your praise, reaches to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness.  
  
###### 11  
Mount Zion is glad, the daughters of Judah rejoice, on account of Your judgments.  
  
###### 12  
March around Zion, encircle her, count her towers,  
  
###### 13  
consider her ramparts, tour her citadels, that you may tell the next generation.  
  
###### 14  
For this God is our God forever and ever; He will be our guide even till death.
