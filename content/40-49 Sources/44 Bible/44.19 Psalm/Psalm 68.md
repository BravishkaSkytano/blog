###### 1  
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. A song. God arises. His enemies are scattered, and those who hate Him flee His presence.  
  
###### 2  
As smoke is blown away, You will drive them out; as wax melts before the fire, the wicked will perish in the presence of God.  
  
###### 3  
But the righteous will be glad and rejoice before God; they will celebrate with joy.  
  
###### 4  
Sing to God! Sing praises to His name. Exalt Him who rides on the clouds—His name is the LORD—and rejoice before Him.  
  
###### 5  
A father of the fatherless, and a defender of the widows, is God in His holy habitation.  
  
###### 6  
God settles the lonely in families; He leads the prisoners out to prosperity, but the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched land.  
  
###### 7  
O God, when You went out before Your people, when You marched through the wasteland, Selah  
  
###### 8  
the earth shook and the heavens poured down rain before God, the One on Sinai, before God, the God of Israel.  
  
###### 9  
You sent abundant rain, O God; You refreshed Your weary inheritance.  
  
###### 10  
Your flock settled therein; O God, from Your bounty You provided for the poor.  
  
###### 11  
The Lord gives the command; a great company of women proclaim it:  
  
###### 12  
“Kings and their armies flee in haste; she who waits at home divides the plunder.  
  
###### 13  
Though you lie down among the sheepfolds, the wings of the dove are covered with silver, and her feathers with shimmering gold.”  
  
###### 14  
When the Almighty scattered the kings in the land, it was like the snow falling on Zalmon.  
  
###### 15  
A mountain of God is Mount Bashan; a mountain of many peaks is Mount Bashan.  
  
###### 16  
Why do you gaze in envy, O mountains of many peaks? This is the mountain God chose for His dwelling, where the LORD will surely dwell forever.  
  
###### 17  
The chariots of God are tens of thousands—thousands of thousands are they; the Lord is in His sanctuary as He was at Sinai.  
  
###### 18  
You have ascended on high; You have led captives away. You have received gifts from men, even from the rebellious, that the LORD God may dwell there.  
  
###### 19  
Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burden, the God of our salvation. Selah  
  
###### 20  
Our God is a God of deliverance; the Lord GOD is our rescuer from death.  
  
###### 21  
Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies, the hairy crowns of those who persist in guilty ways.  
  
###### 22  
The Lord said, “I will retrieve them from Bashan, I will bring them up from the depths of the sea,  
  
###### 23  
that your foot may be dipped in the blood of your foes—the tongues of your dogs in the same.”  
  
###### 24  
They have seen Your procession, O God—the march of my God and King into the sanctuary.  
  
###### 25  
The singers lead the way, the musicians follow after, among the maidens playing tambourines.  
  
###### 26  
Bless God in the great congregation; bless the LORD from the fountain of Israel.  
  
###### 27  
There is Benjamin, the youngest, ruling them, the princes of Judah in their company, the princes of Zebulun and of Naphtali.  
  
###### 28  
Summon Your power, O God; show Your strength, O God, which You have exerted on our behalf.  
  
###### 29  
Because of Your temple at Jerusalem kings will bring You gifts.  
  
###### 30  
Rebuke the beast in the reeds, the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations, until it submits, bringing bars of silver. Scatter the nations who delight in war.  
  
###### 31  
Envoys will arrive from Egypt; Cush will stretch out her hands to God.  
  
###### 32  
Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth; sing praises to the Lord—Selah  
  
###### 33  
to Him who rides upon the highest heavens of old; behold, His mighty voice resounds.  
  
###### 34  
Ascribe the power to God, whose majesty is over Israel, whose strength is in the skies.  
  
###### 35  
O God, You are awesome in Your sanctuary; the God of Israel Himself gives strength and power to His people. Blessed be God!
