###### 1  
For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Lilies of the Covenant.” A Psalm of Asaph. Hear us, O Shepherd of Israel, who leads Joseph like a flock; You who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth  
  
###### 2  
before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh. Rally Your mighty power and come to save us.  
  
###### 3  
Restore us, O God, and cause Your face to shine upon us, that we may be saved.  
  
###### 4  
O LORD God of Hosts, how long will Your anger smolder against the prayers of Your people?  
  
###### 5  
You fed them with the bread of tears and made them drink the full measure of their tears.  
  
###### 6  
You make us contend with our neighbors; our enemies mock us.  
  
###### 7  
Restore us, O God of Hosts, and cause Your face to shine upon us, that we may be saved.  
  
###### 8  
You uprooted a vine from Egypt; You drove out the nations and transplanted it.  
  
###### 9  
You cleared the ground for it, and it took root and filled the land.  
  
###### 10  
The mountains were covered by its shade, and the mighty cedars with its branches.  
  
###### 11  
It sent out its branches to the Sea, and its shoots toward the River.  
  
###### 12  
Why have You broken down its walls, so that all who pass by pick its fruit?  
  
###### 13  
The boar from the forest ravages it, and the creatures of the field feed upon it.  
  
###### 14  
Return, O God of Hosts, we pray! Look down from heaven and see! Attend to this vine—  
  
###### 15  
the root Your right hand has planted, the son You have raised up for Yourself.  
  
###### 16  
Your vine has been cut down and burned; they perish at the rebuke of Your countenance.  
  
###### 17  
Let Your hand be upon the man at Your right hand, on the son of man You have raised up for Yourself.  
  
###### 18  
Then we will not turn away from You; revive us, and we will call on Your name.  
  
###### 19  
Restore us, O LORD God of Hosts; cause Your face to shine upon us, that we may be saved.
