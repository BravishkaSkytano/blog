###### 1  
Of David. Vindicate me, O LORD! For I have walked with integrity; I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.  
  
###### 2  
Test me, O LORD, and try me; examine my heart and mind.  
  
###### 3  
For Your loving devotion is before my eyes, and I have walked in Your truth.  
  
###### 4  
I do not sit with deceitful men, nor keep company with hypocrites.  
  
###### 5  
I hate the mob of evildoers, and refuse to sit with the wicked.  
  
###### 6  
I wash my hands in innocence that I may go about Your altar, O LORD,  
  
###### 7  
to raise my voice in thanksgiving and declare all Your wonderful works.  
  
###### 8  
O LORD, I love the house where You dwell, the place where Your glory resides.  
  
###### 9  
Do not take my soul away with sinners, or my life with men of bloodshed,  
  
###### 10  
in whose hands are wicked schemes, whose right hands are full of bribes.  
  
###### 11  
But I will walk with integrity; redeem me and be merciful to me.  
  
###### 12  
My feet stand on level ground; in the congregations I will bless the LORD.
