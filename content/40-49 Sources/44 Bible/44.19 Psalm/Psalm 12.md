###### 1  
For the choirmaster. According to Sheminith. A Psalm of David. Help, O LORD, for the godly are no more; the faithful have vanished from among men.  
  
###### 2  
They lie to one another; they speak with flattering lips and a double heart.  
  
###### 3  
May the LORD cut off all flattering lips and every boastful tongue.  
  
###### 4  
They say, “With our tongues we will prevail. We own our lips—who can be our master?”  
  
###### 5  
“For the cause of the oppressed and for the groaning of the needy, I will now arise,” says the LORD. “I will bring safety to him who yearns.”  
  
###### 6  
The words of the LORD are flawless, like silver refined in a furnace, like gold purified sevenfold.  
  
###### 7  
You, O LORD, will keep us; You will forever guard us from this generation.  
  
###### 8  
The wicked wander freely, and vileness is exalted among men.
