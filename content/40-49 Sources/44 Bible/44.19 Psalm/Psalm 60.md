###### 1  
For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Lily of the Covenant.” A Miktam of David for instruction. When he fought Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah, and Joab returned and struck down 12,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. You have rejected us, O God; You have broken us; You have been angry; restore us!  
  
###### 2  
You have shaken the land and torn it open. Heal its fractures, for it is quaking.  
  
###### 3  
You have shown Your people hardship; we are staggered from the wine You made us drink.  
  
###### 4  
You have raised a banner for those who fear You, that they may flee the bow. Selah  
  
###### 5  
Respond and save us with Your right hand, that Your beloved may be delivered.  
  
###### 6  
God has spoken from His sanctuary: “I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem and apportion the Valley of Succoth.  
  
###### 7  
Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim is My helmet, Judah is My scepter.  
  
###### 8  
Moab is My washbasin; upon Edom I toss My sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph.”  
  
###### 9  
Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?  
  
###### 10  
Have You not rejected us, O God? Will You no longer march out, O God, with our armies?  
  
###### 11  
Give us aid against the enemy, for the help of man is worthless.  
  
###### 12  
With God we will perform with valor, and He will trample our enemies.
