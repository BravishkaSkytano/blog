###### 1  
Hallelujah! How good it is to sing praises to our God, how pleasant and lovely to praise Him!  
  
###### 2  
The LORD builds up Jerusalem; He gathers the exiles of Israel.  
  
###### 3  
He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.  
  
###### 4  
He determines the number of the stars; He calls them each by name.  
  
###### 5  
Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; His understanding has no limit.  
  
###### 6  
The LORD sustains the humble, but casts the wicked to the ground.  
  
###### 7  
Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; make music on the harp to our God,  
  
###### 8  
who covers the sky with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who makes grass to grow on the hills.  
  
###### 9  
He provides food for the animals, and for the young ravens when they call.  
  
###### 10  
He does not delight in the strength of the horse; He takes no pleasure in the legpower of the man.  
  
###### 11  
The LORD is pleased with those who fear Him, who hope in His loving devotion.  
  
###### 12  
Exalt the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Zion!  
  
###### 13  
For He strengthens the bars of your gates and blesses the children within you.  
  
###### 14  
He makes peace at your borders; He fills you with the finest wheat.  
  
###### 15  
He sends forth His command to the earth; His word runs swiftly.  
  
###### 16  
He spreads the snow like wool; He scatters the frost like ashes;  
  
###### 17  
He casts forth His hail like pebbles. Who can withstand His icy blast?  
  
###### 18  
He sends forth His word and melts them; He unleashes His winds, and the waters flow.  
  
###### 19  
He declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and judgments to Israel.  
  
###### 20  
He has done this for no other nation; they do not know His judgments. Hallelujah!
