###### 1  
A Maskil of David, when he was in the cave. A prayer. I cry aloud to the LORD; I lift my voice to the LORD for mercy.  
  
###### 2  
I pour out my complaint before Him; I reveal my trouble to Him.  
  
###### 3  
Although my spirit grows faint within me, You know my way. Along the path I travel they have hidden a snare for me.  
  
###### 4  
Look to my right and see; no one attends to me. There is no refuge for me; no one cares for my soul.  
  
###### 5  
I cry to You, O LORD: “You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.”  
  
###### 6  
Listen to my cry, for I am brought quite low. Rescue me from my pursuers, for they are too strong for me.  
  
###### 7  
Free my soul from prison, that I may praise Your name. The righteous will gather around me because of Your goodness to me.
