###### 1  
Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, or set foot on the path of sinners, or sit in the seat of mockers.  
  
###### 2  
But his delight is in the Law of the LORD, and on His law he meditates day and night.  
  
###### 3  
He is like a tree planted by streams of water, yielding its fruit in season, whose leaf does not wither, and who prospers in all he does.  
  
###### 4  
Not so the wicked! For they are like chaff driven off by the wind.  
  
###### 5  
Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.  
  
###### 6  
For the LORD guards the path of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.
