###### 1  
The LORD reigns! He is robed in majesty; the LORD has clothed and armed Himself with strength. The world indeed is firmly established; it cannot be moved.  
  
###### 2  
Your throne was established long ago; You are from all eternity.  
  
###### 3  
The floodwaters have risen, O LORD; the rivers have raised their voice; the seas lift up their pounding waves.  
  
###### 4  
Above the roar of many waters—the mighty breakers of the sea—the LORD on high is majestic.  
  
###### 5  
Your testimonies are fully confirmed; holiness adorns Your house, O LORD, for all the days to come.
