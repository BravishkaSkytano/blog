###### 1  
For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam of David, when he fled from Saul into the cave. Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy, for in You my soul takes refuge. In the shadow of Your wings I will take shelter until the danger has passed.  
  
###### 2  
I cry out to God Most High, to God who fulfills His purpose for me.  
  
###### 3  
He reaches down from heaven and saves me; He rebukes those who trample me. Selah God sends forth His loving devotion and His truth.  
  
###### 4  
My soul is among the lions; I lie down with ravenous beasts—with men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.  
  
###### 5  
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; may Your glory cover all the earth.  
  
###### 6  
They spread a net for my feet; my soul was despondent. They dug a pit before me, but they themselves have fallen into it! Selah  
  
###### 7  
My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast. I will sing and make music.  
  
###### 8  
Awake, my glory! Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.  
  
###### 9  
I will praise You, O Lord, among the nations; I will sing Your praises among the peoples.  
  
###### 10  
For Your loving devotion reaches to the heavens, and Your faithfulness to the clouds.  
  
###### 11  
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; may Your glory cover all the earth.
