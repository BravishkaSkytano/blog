###### 1  
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. Blessed is the one who cares for the poor; the LORD will deliver him in the day of trouble.  
  
###### 2  
The LORD will protect and preserve him; He will bless him in the land and refuse to surrender him to the will of his foes.  
  
###### 3  
The LORD will sustain him on his bed of illness and restore him from his bed of sickness.  
  
###### 4  
I said, “O LORD, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against You.”  
  
###### 5  
My enemies say with malice: “When will he die and be forgotten?”  
  
###### 6  
My visitor speaks falsehood; he gathers slander in his heart; he goes out and spreads it abroad.  
  
###### 7  
All who hate me whisper against me; they imagine the worst for me:  
  
###### 8  
“A vile disease has been poured into him; he will never get up from where he lies!”  
  
###### 9  
Even my close friend whom I trusted, the one who shared my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.  
  
###### 10  
But You, O LORD, be gracious to me and raise me up, that I may repay them.  
  
###### 11  
By this I know that You delight in me, for my enemy does not triumph over me.  
  
###### 12  
In my integrity You uphold me and set me in Your presence forever.  
  
###### 13  
Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.
