###### 2  
many a time they have persecuted me from my youth, but they have not prevailed against me.  
  
###### 3  
The plowmen plowed over my back; they made their furrows long.  
  
###### 4  
The LORD is righteous; He has cut me from the cords of the wicked.  
  
###### 5  
May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame.  
  
###### 6

###### 7

###### 8
