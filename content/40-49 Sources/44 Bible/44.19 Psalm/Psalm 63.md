###### 1  
A Psalm of David, when he was in the Wilderness of Judah. O God, You are my God. Earnestly I seek You; my soul thirsts for You. My body yearns for You in a dry and weary land without water.  
  
###### 2  
So I have seen You in the sanctuary and beheld Your power and glory.  
  
###### 3  
Because Your loving devotion is better than life, my lips will glorify You.  
  
###### 4  
So I will bless You as long as I live; in Your name I will lift my hands.  
  
###### 5  
My soul is satisfied as with the richest of foods; with joyful lips my mouth will praise You.  
  
###### 6  
When I remember You on my bed, I think of You through the watches of the night.  
  
###### 7  
For You are my help; I will sing for joy in the shadow of Your wings.  
  
###### 8  
My soul clings to You; Your right hand upholds me.  
  
###### 9  
But those who seek my life to destroy it will go into the depths of the earth.  
  
###### 10  
They will fall to the power of the sword; they will become a portion for foxes.  
  
###### 11  
But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by Him will exult, for the mouths of liars will be shut.
