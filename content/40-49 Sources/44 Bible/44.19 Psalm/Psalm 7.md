###### 1  
A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the LORD concerning the words of Cush, a Benjamite. O LORD my God, I take refuge in You; save me and deliver me from all my pursuers,  
  
###### 2  
or they will shred my soul like a lion and tear me to pieces with no one to rescue me.  
  
###### 3  
O LORD my God, if I have done this, if injustice is on my hands,  
  
###### 4  
if I have rewarded my ally with evil, if I have plundered my foe without cause,  
  
###### 5  
then may my enemy pursue me and overtake me; may he trample me to the ground and leave my honor in the dust. Selah  
  
###### 6  
Arise, O LORD, in Your anger; rise up against the fury of my enemies. Awake, my God, and ordain judgment.  
  
###### 7  
Let the assembled peoples gather around You; take Your seat over them on high.  
  
###### 8  
The LORD judges the peoples; vindicate me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and integrity.  
  
###### 9  
Put an end to the evil of the wicked, but establish the righteous, O righteous God who searches hearts and minds.  
  
###### 10  
My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.  
  
###### 11  
God is a righteous judge and a God who feels indignation each day.  
  
###### 12  
If one does not repent, God will sharpen His sword; He has bent and strung His bow.  
  
###### 13  
He has prepared His deadly weapons; He ordains His arrows with fire.  
  
###### 14  
Behold, the wicked man travails with evil; he conceives trouble and births falsehood.  
  
###### 15  
He has dug a hole and hollowed it out; he has fallen into a pit of his own making.  
  
###### 16  
His trouble recoils on himself, and his violence falls on his own head.  
  
###### 17  
I will thank the LORD for His righteousness and sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.
