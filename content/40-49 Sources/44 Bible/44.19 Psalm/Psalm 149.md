###### 1  
Hallelujah! Sing to the LORD a new song—His praise in the assembly of the godly.  
  
###### 2  
Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; let the children of Zion rejoice in their King.  
  
###### 3  
Let them praise His name with dancing, and make music to Him with tambourine and harp.  
  
###### 4  
For the LORD takes pleasure in His people; He adorns the afflicted with salvation.  
  
###### 5  
Let the saints exult in glory; let them shout for joy upon their beds.  
  
###### 6  
May the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a double-edged sword in their hands,  
  
###### 7  
to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples,  
  
###### 8  
to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with shackles of iron,  
  
###### 9  
to execute the judgment written against them. This honor is for all His saints. Hallelujah!
