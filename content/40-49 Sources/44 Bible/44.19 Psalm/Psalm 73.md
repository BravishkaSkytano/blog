###### 1  
A Psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.  
  
###### 2  
But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled; my steps had nearly slipped.  
  
###### 3  
For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.  
  
###### 4  
They have no struggle in their death; their bodies are well-fed.  
  
###### 5  
They are free of the burdens others carry; they are not afflicted like other men.  
  
###### 6  
Therefore pride is their necklace; a garment of violence covers them.  
  
###### 7  
From their prosperity proceeds iniquity; the imaginations of their hearts run wild.  
  
###### 8  
They mock and speak with malice; with arrogance they threaten oppression.  
  
###### 9  
They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongues strut across the earth.  
  
###### 10  
So their people return to this place and drink up waters in abundance.  
  
###### 11  
The wicked say, “How can God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?”  
  
###### 12  
Behold, these are the wicked—always carefree as they increase their wealth.  
  
###### 13  
Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure; in innocence I have washed my hands.  
  
###### 14  
For I am afflicted all day long and punished every morning.  
  
###### 15  
If I had said, “I will speak this way,” then I would have betrayed Your children.  
  
###### 16  
When I tried to understand all this, it was troublesome in my sight  
  
###### 17  
until I entered God’s sanctuary; then I discerned their end.  
  
###### 18  
Surely You set them on slick ground; You cast them down into ruin.  
  
###### 19  
How suddenly they are laid waste, completely swept away by terrors!  
  
###### 20  
Like one waking from a dream, so You, O Lord, awaken and despise their form.  
  
###### 21  
When my heart was grieved and I was pierced within,  
  
###### 22  
I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before You.  
  
###### 23  
Yet I am always with You; You hold my right hand.  
  
###### 24  
You guide me with Your counsel, and later receive me in glory.  
  
###### 25  
Whom have I in heaven but You? And on earth I desire no one besides You.  
  
###### 26  
My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.  
  
###### 27  
Those far from You will surely perish; You destroy all who are unfaithful to You.  
  
###### 28  
But as for me, it is good to draw near to God. I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, that I may proclaim all Your works.
