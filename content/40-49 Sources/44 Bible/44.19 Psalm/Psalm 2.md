###### 1  
Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?  
  
###### 2  
The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together, against the LORD and against His Anointed One:  
  
###### 3  
“Let us break Their chains and cast away Their cords.”  
  
###### 4  
The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord taunts them.  
  
###### 5  
Then He rebukes them in His anger, and terrifies them in His fury:  
  
###### 6  
“I have installed My King on Zion, upon My holy mountain.”  
  
###### 7  
I will proclaim the decree spoken to Me by the LORD: “You are My Son; today I have become Your Father.  
  
###### 8  
Ask Me, and I will make the nations Your inheritance, the ends of the earth Your possession.  
  
###### 9  
You will break them with an iron scepter; You will shatter them like pottery.”  
  
###### 10  
Therefore be wise, O kings; be admonished, O judges of the earth.  
  
###### 11  
Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.  
  
###### 12  
Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and you perish in your rebellion, when His wrath ignites in an instant. Blessed are all who take refuge in Him.
