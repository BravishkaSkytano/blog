A song of ascents. In my distress I cried to the LORD, and He answered me.  
  
###### 2  
Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips and a deceitful tongue.  
  
###### 3  
What will He do to you, and what will be added to you, O deceitful tongue?  
  
###### 4  
Sharp arrows will come from the warrior, with burning coals of the broom tree!  
  
###### 5  
Woe to me that I dwell in Meshech, that I live among the tents of Kedar!  
  
###### 6  
Too long have I dwelt among those who hate peace.  
  
###### 7
