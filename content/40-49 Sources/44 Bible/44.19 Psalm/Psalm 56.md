###### 1  
For the choirmaster. To the tune of “A Dove on Distant Oaks.” A Miktam of David, when the Philistines seized him in Gath. Be merciful to me, O God, for men are hounding me; all day they press their attack.  
  
###### 2  
My enemies pursue me all day long, for many proudly assail me.  
  
###### 3  
When I am afraid, I put my trust in You.  
  
###### 4  
In God, whose word I praise—in God I trust. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?  
  
###### 5  
All day long they twist my words; all their thoughts are on my demise.  
  
###### 6  
They conspire, they lurk, they watch my steps while they wait to take my life.  
  
###### 7  
In spite of such sin, will they escape? In Your anger, O God, cast down the nations.  
  
###### 8  
You have taken account of my wanderings. Put my tears in Your bottle—are they not in Your book?  
  
###### 9  
Then my enemies will retreat on the day I cry for help. By this I will know that God is on my side.  
  
###### 10  
In God, whose word I praise, in the LORD, whose word I praise,  
  
###### 11  
in God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?  
  
###### 12  
Your vows are upon me, O God; I will render thank offerings to You.  
  
###### 13  
For You have delivered my soul from death, and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.
