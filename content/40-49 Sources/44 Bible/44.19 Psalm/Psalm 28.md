###### 1  
Of David. To You, O LORD, I call; be not deaf to me, O my Rock. For if You remain silent, I will be like those descending to the Pit.  
  
###### 2  
Hear my cry for mercy when I call to You for help, when I lift up my hands toward Your holy sanctuary.  
  
###### 3  
Do not drag me away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbors while malice is in their hearts.  
  
###### 4  
Repay them according to their deeds and for their works of evil. Repay them for what their hands have done; bring back on them what they deserve.  
  
###### 5  
Since they show no regard for the works of the LORD or what His hands have done, He will tear them down and never rebuild them.  
  
###### 6  
Blessed be the LORD, for He has heard my cry for mercy.  
  
###### 7  
The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in Him, and I am helped. Therefore my heart rejoices, and I give thanks to Him with my song.  
  
###### 8  
The LORD is the strength of His people, a stronghold of salvation for His anointed.  
  
###### 9  
Save Your people and bless Your inheritance; shepherd them and carry them forever.
