###### 1  
For the choirmaster. A Maskil of the sons of Korah. We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us the work You did in their days, in the days of old.  
  
###### 2  
With Your hand You drove out the nations and planted our fathers there; You crushed the peoples and cast them out.  
  
###### 3  
For it was not by their sword that they took the land; their arm did not bring them victory. It was by Your right hand, Your arm, and the light of Your face, because You favored them.  
  
###### 4  
You are my King, O God, who ordains victories for Jacob.  
  
###### 5  
Through You we repel our foes; through Your name we trample our enemies.  
  
###### 6  
For I do not trust in my bow, nor does my sword save me.  
  
###### 7  
For You save us from our enemies; You put those who hate us to shame.  
  
###### 8  
In God we have boasted all day long, and Your name we will praise forever. Selah  
  
###### 9  
But You have rejected and humbled us; You no longer go forth with our armies.  
  
###### 10  
You have made us retreat from the foe, and those who hate us have plundered us.  
  
###### 11  
You have given us up as sheep to be devoured; You have scattered us among the nations.  
  
###### 12  
You sell Your people for nothing; no profit do You gain from their sale.  
  
###### 13  
You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, a mockery and derision to those around us.  
  
###### 14  
You have made us a byword among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples.  
  
###### 15  
All day long my disgrace is before me, and shame has covered my face,  
  
###### 16  
at the voice of the scorner and reviler, because of the enemy, bent on revenge.  
  
###### 17  
All this has come upon us, though we have not forgotten You or betrayed Your covenant.  
  
###### 18  
Our hearts have not turned back; our steps have not strayed from Your path.  
  
###### 19  
But You have crushed us in the lair of jackals; You have covered us with deepest darkness.  
  
###### 20  
If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,  
  
###### 21  
would not God have discovered, since He knows the secrets of the heart?  
  
###### 22  
Yet for Your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.  
  
###### 23  
Wake up, O Lord! Why are You sleeping? Arise! Do not reject us forever.  
  
###### 24  
Why do You hide Your face and forget our affliction and oppression?  
  
###### 25  
For our soul has sunk to the dust; our bodies cling to the earth.  
  
###### 26  
Rise up; be our help! Redeem us on account of Your loving devotion.
