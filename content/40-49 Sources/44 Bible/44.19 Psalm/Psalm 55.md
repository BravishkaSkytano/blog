###### 1  
For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Maskil of David. Listen to my prayer, O God, and do not ignore my plea.  
  
###### 2  
Attend to me and answer me. I am restless in my complaint, and distraught  
  
###### 3  
at the voice of the enemy, at the pressure of the wicked. For they release disaster upon me and revile me in their anger.  
  
###### 4  
My heart murmurs within me, and the terrors of death assail me.  
  
###### 5  
Fear and trembling grip me, and horror has overwhelmed me.  
  
###### 6  
I said, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and find rest.  
  
###### 7  
How far away I would flee! In the wilderness I would remain. Selah  
  
###### 8  
I would hurry to my shelter, far from this raging tempest.”  
  
###### 9  
O Lord, confuse and confound their speech, for I see violence and strife in the city.  
  
###### 10  
Day and night they encircle the walls, while malice and trouble lie within.  
  
###### 11  
Destruction is within; oppression and deceit never leave the streets.  
  
###### 12  
For it is not an enemy who insults me; that I could endure. It is not a foe who rises against me; from him I could hide.  
  
###### 13  
But it is you, a man like myself, my companion and close friend.  
  
###### 14  
We shared sweet fellowship together; we walked with the crowd into the house of God.  
  
###### 15  
Let death seize them by surprise; let them go down to Sheol alive, for evil is with them in their homes.  
  
###### 16  
But I call to God, and the LORD saves me.  
  
###### 17  
Morning, noon, and night, I cry out in distress, and He hears my voice.  
  
###### 18  
He redeems my soul in peace from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me.  
  
###### 19  
God will hear and humiliate them—the One enthroned for the ages—Selah because they do not change and they have no fear of God.  
  
###### 20  
My companion attacks his friends; he violates his covenant.  
  
###### 21  
His speech is smooth as butter, but war is in his heart. His words are softer than oil, yet they are swords unsheathed.  
  
###### 22  
Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you; He will never let the righteous be shaken.  
  
###### 23  
But You, O God, will bring them down to the Pit of destruction; men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their days. But I will trust in You.
