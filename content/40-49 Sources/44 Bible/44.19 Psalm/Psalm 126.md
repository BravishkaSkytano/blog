###### 1  
A song of ascents. When the LORD restored the captives of Zion, we were like dreamers.  
  
###### 2  
Then our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with shouts of joy. Then it was said among the nations, “The LORD has done great things for them.”  
  
###### 3  
The LORD has done great things for us; we are filled with joy.  
  
###### 4  
Restore our captives, O LORD, like streams in the Negev.  
  
###### 5  
Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy.  
  
###### 6  
He who goes out weeping, bearing a trail of seed, will surely return with shouts of joy, carrying sheaves of grain.
