Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever.

Light dawns in the darkness for the upright—for the gracious, compassionate, and righteous.  
  
###### 5  
It is well with the man who is generous and lends freely, whose affairs are guided by justice.  
  
###### 6  
Surely he will never be shaken; the righteous man will be remembered forever.  
  
###### 7  
He does not fear bad news; his heart is steadfast, trusting in the LORD.  
  
###### 8  
His heart is assured; he does not fear, until he looks in triumph on his foes.  
  
###### 9  
He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor; his righteousness endures forever; his horn will be lifted high in honor.  
  
###### 10  
The wicked man will see and be grieved; he will gnash his teeth and waste away; the desires of the wicked will perish.
