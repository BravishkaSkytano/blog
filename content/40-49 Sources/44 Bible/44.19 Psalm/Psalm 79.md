###### 1  
A Psalm of Asaph. The nations, O God, have invaded Your inheritance; they have defiled Your holy temple and reduced Jerusalem to rubble.  
  
###### 2  
They have given the corpses of Your servants as food to the birds of the air, the flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth.  
  
###### 3  
They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury the dead.  
  
###### 4  
We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to those around us.  
  
###### 5  
How long, O LORD? Will You be angry forever? Will Your jealousy burn like fire?  
  
###### 6  
Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that refuse to call on Your name,  
  
###### 7  
for they have devoured Jacob and devastated his homeland.  
  
###### 8  
Do not hold past sins against us; let Your compassion come quickly, for we are brought low.  
  
###### 9  
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name; deliver us and atone for our sins, for the sake of Your name.  
  
###### 10  
Why should the nations ask, “Where is their God?” Before our eyes, make known among the nations Your vengeance for the bloodshed of Your servants.  
  
###### 11  
May the groans of the captives reach You; by the strength of Your arm preserve those condemned to death.  
  
###### 12  
Pay back into the laps of our neighbors sevenfold the reproach they hurled at You, O Lord.  
  
###### 13  
Then we Your people, the sheep of Your pasture, will thank You forever; from generation to generation we will declare Your praise.
