###### 1  
A song of ascents. Of David. If the LORD had not been on our side—let Israel now declare—  
  
###### 2  
if the LORD had not been on our side when men attacked us,  
  
###### 3  
when their anger flared against us, then they would have swallowed us alive,  
  
###### 4  
then the floods would have engulfed us, then the torrent would have overwhelmed us,  
  
###### 5  
then the raging waters would have swept us away.  
  
###### 6  
Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as prey to their teeth.  
  
###### 7  
We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowler; the net is torn, and we have slipped away.  
  
###### 8  
Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
