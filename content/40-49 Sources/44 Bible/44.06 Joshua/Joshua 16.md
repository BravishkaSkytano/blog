###### 4  
So Ephraim and Manasseh, the sons of Joseph, received their inheritance.

###### 8  
From Tappuah the border went westward to the Brook of Kanah and ended at the Sea. This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Ephraim,  
  
###### 9  
along with all the cities and villages set apart for the descendants of Ephraim within the inheritance of Manasseh.  
  
###### 10
