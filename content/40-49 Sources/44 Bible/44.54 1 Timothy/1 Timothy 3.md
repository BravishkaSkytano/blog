###### 1  
This is a trustworthy saying: If anyone aspires to be an overseer, he desires a noble task.  
  
###### 2  
An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,  
  
###### 3  
not dependent on wine, not violent but gentle, peaceable, and free of the love of money.  
  
###### 4  
An overseer must manage his own household well and keep his children under control, with complete dignity.  
  
###### 5  
For if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how can he care for the church of God?  
  
###### 6  
He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same condemnation as the devil.  
  
###### 7  
Furthermore, he must have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the snare of the devil.  
  
###### 8  
Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued or given to much wine or greedy for money.  
  
###### 9  
They must hold to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.  
  
###### 10  
Additionally, they must first be tested. Then, if they are above reproach, let them serve as deacons.  
  
###### 11  
In the same way, the women must be dignified, not slanderers, but temperate and faithful in all things.  
  
###### 12  
A deacon must be the husband of but one wife, a good manager of his children and of his own household.  
  
###### 13  
For those who have served well as deacons acquire for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.  
  
###### 14  
Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these things  
  
###### 15  
in case I am delayed, so that you will know how each one must conduct himself in God’s household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.  
  
###### 16  
By common confession, the mystery of godliness is great: He appeared in the flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was proclaimed among the nations, was believed in throughout the world, was taken up in glory.
