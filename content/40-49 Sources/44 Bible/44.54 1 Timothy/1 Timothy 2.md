###### 1  
First of all, then, I urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be offered for everyone—  
  
###### 2  
for kings and all those in authority—so that we may lead tranquil and quiet lives in all godliness and dignity.  
  
###### 3  
This is good and pleasing in the sight of God our Savior,  
  
###### 4  
who wants everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.  
  
###### 5  
For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,  
  
###### 6  
who gave Himself as a ransom for all—the testimony that was given at just the right time.  
  
###### 7  
For this reason I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a faithful and true teacher of the Gentiles. I am telling the truth; I am not lying about anything.  
  
###### 8  
Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger or dissension.  
  
###### 9  
Likewise, I want the women to adorn themselves with respectable apparel, with modesty, and with self-control, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,  
  
###### 10  
but with good deeds, as is proper for women who profess to worship God.  
  
###### 11  
A woman must learn in quietness and full submissiveness.  
  
###### 12  
I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; she is to remain quiet.  
  
###### 13  
For Adam was formed first, and then Eve.  
  
###### 14  
And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman who was deceived and fell into transgression.  
  
###### 15  
Women, however, will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control.
