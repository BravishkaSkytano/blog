###### 1  
Then the whole council rose and led Jesus away to Pilate.  
  
###### 2  
And they began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding payment of taxes to Caesar, and proclaiming Himself to be Christ, a King.”  
  
###### 3  
So Pilate asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied.  
  
###### 4  
Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”  
  
###### 5  
But they kept insisting, “He stirs up the people all over Judea with His teaching. He began in Galilee and has come all the way here.”  
  
###### 6  
When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean.  
  
###### 7  
And learning that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself was in Jerusalem at that time.  
  
###### 8  
When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased. He had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had heard about Him and was hoping to see Him perform a miracle.  
  
###### 9  
Herod questioned Jesus at great length, but He gave no answer.  
  
###### 10  
Meanwhile, the chief priests and scribes stood there, vehemently accusing Him.  
  
###### 11  
And even Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked Him. Dressing Him in a fine robe, they sent Him back to Pilate.  
  
###### 12  
That day Herod and Pilate became friends; before this time they had been enemies.  
  
###### 13  
Then Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,  
  
###### 14  
and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined Him here in your presence and found Him not guilty of your charges against Him.  
  
###### 15  
Neither has Herod, for he sent Him back to us. As you can see, He has done nothing deserving of death.  
  
###### 16  
Therefore I will punish Him and release Him.”  
  
###### 18  
But they all cried out in unison: “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!”  
  
###### 19  
(Barabbas had been imprisoned for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)  
  
###### 20  
Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate addressed them again,  
  
###### 21  
but they kept shouting, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!”  
  
###### 22  
A third time he said to them, “What evil has this man done? I have found in Him no offense worthy of death. So after I punish Him, I will release Him.”  
  
###### 23  
But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices for Jesus to be crucified. And their clamor prevailed.  
  
###### 24  
So Pilate sentenced that their demand be met.  
  
###### 25  
As they had requested, he released the one imprisoned for insurrection and murder, and handed Jesus over to their will.  
  
###### 26  
As the soldiers led Him away, they seized Simon of Cyrene on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him to carry behind Jesus.  
  
###### 27  
A great number of people followed Him, including women who kept mourning and wailing for Him.  
  
###### 28  
But Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.  
  
###### 29  
Look, the days are coming when people will say, ‘Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore, and breasts that never nursed!’  
  
###### 30  
At that time ‘they will say to the mountains, “Fall on us!” and to the hills, “Cover us!”’  
  
###### 31  
For if men do these things while the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?”  
  
###### 32  
Two others, who were criminals, were also led away to be executed with Jesus.  
  
###### 33  
When they came to the place called The Skull, they crucified Him there, along with the criminals, one on His right and the other on His left.  
  
###### 34  
Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” And they divided up His garments by casting lots.  
  
###### 35  
The people stood watching, and the rulers sneered at Him, saying, “He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.”  
  
###### 36  
The soldiers also mocked Him and came up to offer Him sour wine.  
  
###### 37  
“If You are the King of the Jews,” they said, “save Yourself!”  
  
###### 38  
Above Him was posted an inscription: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.  
  
###### 39  
One of the criminals who hung there heaped abuse on Him. “Are You not the Christ?” he said. “Save Yourself and us!”  
  
###### 40  
But the other one rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same judgment?  
  
###### 41  
We are punished justly, for we are receiving what our actions deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.”  
  
###### 42  
Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom!”  
  
###### 43  
And Jesus said to him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.”  
  
###### 44  
It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour.  
  
###### 45  
The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn down the middle.  
  
###### 46  
Then Jesus called out in a loud voice, “Father, into Your hands I commit My Spirit.” And when He had said this, He breathed His last.  
  
###### 47  
When the centurion saw what had happened, he gave glory to God, saying, “Surely this was a righteous man.”  
  
###### 48  
And when all the people who had gathered for this spectacle saw what had happened, they returned home beating their breasts.  
  
###### 49  
But all those who knew Jesus, including the women who had followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance watching these things.  
  
###### 50  
Now there was a Council member named Joseph, a good and righteous man,  
  
###### 51  
who had not consented to their decision or action. He was from the Judean town of Arimathea, and was waiting for the kingdom of God.  
  
###### 52  
He went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus.  
  
###### 53  
Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and placed it in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had yet been laid.  
  
###### 54  
It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was beginning.  
  
###### 55  
The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how His body was placed.  
  
###### 56  
Then they returned to prepare spices and perfumes. And they rested on the Sabbath, according to the commandment.
