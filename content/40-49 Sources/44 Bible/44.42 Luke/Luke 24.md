###### 1  
On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women came to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared.  
  
###### 2  
They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,  
  
###### 3  
but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.  
  
###### 4  
While they were puzzling over this, suddenly two men in radiant apparel stood beside them.  
  
###### 5  
As the women bowed their faces to the ground in terror, the two men asked them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead?  
  
###### 6  
He is not here; He has risen! Remember how He told you while He was still in Galilee:  
  
###### 7  
‘The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.’”  
  
###### 8  
Then they remembered His words.  
  
###### 9  
And when they returned from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.  
  
###### 10  
It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles.  
  
###### 11  
But their words seemed like nonsense to them, and they did not believe the women.  
  
###### 12  
Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. And after bending down and seeing only the linen cloths, he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.  
  
###### 13  
That same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.  
  
###### 14  
They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.  
  
###### 15  
And as they talked and deliberated, Jesus Himself came up and walked along with them.  
  
###### 16  
But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him.  
  
###### 17  
He asked them, “What are you discussing so intently as you walk along?” They stood still, with sadness on their faces.  
  
###### 18  
One of them, named Cleopas, asked Him, “Are You the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in recent days?”  
  
###### 19  
“What things?” He asked. “The events involving Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. “This man was a prophet, powerful in speech and action before God and all the people.  
  
###### 20  
Our chief priests and rulers delivered Him up to the sentence of death, and they crucified Him.  
  
###### 21  
But we were hoping He was the One who would redeem Israel. And besides all this, it is the third day since these things took place.  
  
###### 22  
Furthermore, some of our women astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning,  
  
###### 23  
but they did not find His body. They came and told us they had seen a vision of angels, who said that Jesus was alive.  
  
###### 24  
Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had described. But Him they did not see.”  
  
###### 25  
Then Jesus said to them, “O foolish ones, how slow are your hearts to believe all that the prophets have spoken!  
  
###### 26  
Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and then to enter His glory?”  
  
###### 27  
And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them what was written in all the Scriptures about Himself.  
  
###### 28  
As they approached the village where they were headed, He seemed to be going farther.  
  
###### 29  
But they pleaded with Him, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over.” So He went in to stay with them.  
  
###### 30  
While He was reclining at the table with them, He took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to them.  
  
###### 31  
Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Jesus—and He disappeared from their sight.  
  
###### 32  
They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us as He spoke with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”  
  
###### 33  
And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, gathered together  
  
###### 34  
and saying, “The Lord has indeed risen and has appeared to Simon!”  
  
###### 35  
Then the two told what had happened on the road, and how they had recognized Jesus in the breaking of the bread.  
  
###### 36  
While they were describing these events, Jesus Himself stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.”  
  
###### 37  
But they were startled and frightened, thinking they had seen a spirit.  
  
###### 38  
“Why are you troubled,” Jesus asked, “and why do doubts arise in your hearts?  
  
###### 39  
Look at My hands and My feet. It is I Myself. Touch Me and see—for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”  
  
###### 40  
And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and feet.  
  
###### 41  
While they were still in disbelief because of their joy and amazement, He asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”  
  
###### 42  
So they gave Him a piece of broiled fish,  
  
###### 43  
and He took it and ate it in front of them.  
  
###### 44  
Jesus said to them, “These are the words I spoke to you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms.”  
  
###### 45  
Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.  
  
###### 46  
And He told them, “This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,  
  
###### 47  
and in His name repentance and forgiveness of sins will be proclaimed to all nations, beginning in Jerusalem.  
  
###### 48  
You are witnesses of these things.  
  
###### 49  
And behold, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you. But remain in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”  
  
###### 50  
When Jesus had led them out as far as Bethany, He lifted up His hands and blessed them.  
  
###### 51  
While He was blessing them, He left them and was carried up into heaven.  
  
###### 52  
And they worshiped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,  
  
###### 53  
praising God continually in the temple.
