###### 1  
Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching,  
  
###### 2  
and the chief priests and scribes were looking for a way to put Jesus to death; for they feared the people.  
  
###### 3  
Then Satan entered Judas Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve.  
  
###### 4  
And Judas went to discuss with the chief priests and temple officers how he might betray Jesus to them.  
  
###### 5  
They were delighted and agreed to give him money.  
  
###### 6  
Judas consented, and began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them in the absence of a crowd.  
  
###### 7  
Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed.  
  
###### 8  
Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare for us to eat the Passover.”  
  
###### 9  
“Where do You want us to prepare it?” they asked.  
  
###### 10  
He answered, “When you enter the city, a man carrying a jug of water will meet you. Follow him to the house he enters,  
  
###### 11  
and say to the owner of that house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?’  
  
###### 12  
And he will show you a large upper room, already furnished. Make preparations there.”  
  
###### 13  
So they went and found it just as Jesus had told them. And they prepared the Passover.  
  
###### 14  
When the hour had come, Jesus reclined at the table with His apostles.  
  
###### 15  
And He said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before My suffering.  
  
###### 16  
For I tell you that I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”  
  
###### 17  
After taking the cup, He gave thanks and said, “Take this and divide it among yourselves.  
  
###### 18  
For I tell you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes.”  
  
###### 19  
And He took the bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is My body, given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”  
  
###### 20  
In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is poured out for you.  
  
###### 21  
Look! The hand of My betrayer is with Mine on the table.  
  
###### 22  
Indeed, the Son of Man will go as it has been determined, but woe to that man who betrays Him.”  
  
###### 23  
Then they began to question among themselves which of them was going to do this.  
  
###### 24  
A dispute also arose among the disciples as to which of them would be considered the greatest.  
  
###### 25  
So Jesus declared, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority over them call themselves benefactors.  
  
###### 26  
But you shall not be like them. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves.  
  
###### 27  
For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as one who serves.  
  
###### 28  
You are the ones who have stood by Me in My trials.  
  
###### 29  
And I bestow on you a kingdom, just as My Father has bestowed one on Me,  
  
###### 30  
so that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.  
  
###### 31  
Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift each of you like wheat.  
  
###### 32  
But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith will not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”  
  
###### 33  
“Lord,” said Peter, “I am ready to go with You even to prison and to death.”  
  
###### 34  
But Jesus replied, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.”  
  
###### 35  
Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you out without purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?” “Nothing,” they answered.  
  
###### 36  
“Now, however,” He told them, “the one with a purse should take it, and likewise a bag; and the one without a sword should sell his cloak and buy one.  
  
###### 37  
For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in Me: ‘And He was numbered with the transgressors.’ For what is written about Me is reaching its fulfillment.”  
  
###### 38  
So they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.” “That is enough,” He answered.  
  
###### 39  
Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed Him.  
  
###### 40  
When He came to the place, He told them, “Pray that you will not enter into temptation.”  
  
###### 41  
And He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, where He knelt down and prayed,  
  
###### 42  
“Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me. Yet not My will, but Yours be done.”  
  
###### 43  
Then an angel from heaven appeared to Him and strengthened Him.  
  
###### 44  
And in His anguish, He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground.  
  
###### 45  
When Jesus rose from prayer and returned to the disciples, He found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.  
  
###### 46  
“Why are you sleeping?” He asked. “Get up and pray so that you will not enter into temptation.”  
  
###### 47  
While He was still speaking, a crowd arrived, led by the man called Judas, one of the Twelve. He approached Jesus to kiss Him.  
  
###### 48  
But Jesus asked him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”  
  
###### 49  
Those around Jesus saw what was about to happen and said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?”  
  
###### 50  
And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.  
  
###### 51  
But Jesus answered, “No more of this!” And He touched the man’s ear and healed him.  
  
###### 52  
Then Jesus said to the chief priests, temple officers, and elders who had come for Him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against an outlaw?  
  
###### 53  
Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on Me. But this hour belongs to you and to the power of darkness.”  
  
###### 54  
Then they seized Jesus, led Him away, and took Him into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed at a distance.  
  
###### 55  
When those present had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them.  
  
###### 56  
A servant girl saw him seated in the firelight and looked intently at him. “This man also was with Him,” she said.  
  
###### 57  
But Peter denied it. “Woman, I do not know Him,” he said.  
  
###### 58  
A short time later, someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.”  
  
###### 59  
About an hour later, another man insisted, “Certainly this man was with Him, for he too is a Galilean.”  
  
###### 60  
“Man, I do not know what you are talking about,” Peter replied. While he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.  
  
###### 61  
And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word that the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.”  
  
###### 62  
And he went outside and wept bitterly.  
  
###### 63  
The men who were holding Jesus began to mock Him and beat Him.  
  
###### 64  
They blindfolded Him and kept demanding, “Prophesy! Who hit You?”  
  
###### 65  
And they said many other blasphemous things against Him.  
  
###### 66  
At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and scribes, met together. They led Jesus into their Sanhedrin and said,  
  
###### 67  
“If You are the Christ, tell us.” Jesus answered, “If I tell you, you will not believe.  
  
###### 68  
And if I ask you a question, you will not answer.  
  
###### 69  
But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”  
  
###### 70  
So they all asked, “Are You then the Son of God?” He replied, “You say that I am.”  
  
###### 71  
“Why do we need any more testimony?” they declared. “We have heard it for ourselves from His own lips.”
