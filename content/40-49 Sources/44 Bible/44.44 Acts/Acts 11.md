###### 1  
The apostles and brothers throughout Judea soon heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.  
  
###### 2  
So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers took issue with him  
  
###### 3  
and said, “You visited uncircumcised men and ate with them.”  
  
###### 4  
But Peter began and explained to them the whole sequence of events:  
  
###### 5  
“I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision of something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came right down to me.  
  
###### 6  
I looked at it closely and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air.  
  
###### 7  
Then I heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter, kill and eat.’  
  
###### 8  
‘No, Lord,’ I said, ‘for nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’  
  
###### 9  
But the voice spoke from heaven a second time, ‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’  
  
###### 10  
This happened three times, and everything was drawn back up into heaven.  
  
###### 11  
Just then three men sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying.  
  
###### 12  
The Spirit told me to accompany them without hesitation. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s home.  
  
###### 13  
He told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.  
  
###### 14  
He will convey to you a message by which you and all your household will be saved.’  
  
###### 15  
As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just as He had fallen upon us at the beginning.  
  
###### 16  
Then I remembered the word of the Lord, as He used to say, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’  
  
###### 17  
So if God gave them the same gift He gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to hinder the work of God?”  
  
###### 18  
When they heard this, their objections were put to rest, and they glorified God, saying, “So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life.”  
  
###### 19  
Meanwhile those scattered by the persecution that began with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the message only to Jews.  
  
###### 20  
But some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks as well, proclaiming the good news about the Lord Jesus.  
  
###### 21  
The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.  
  
###### 22  
When news of this reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, they sent Barnabas to Antioch.  
  
###### 23  
When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced and encouraged them all to abide in the Lord with all their hearts.  
  
###### 24  
Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.  
  
###### 25  
Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,  
  
###### 26  
and when he found him, he brought him back to Antioch. So for a full year they met together with the church and taught large numbers of people. The disciples were first called Christians at Antioch.  
  
###### 27  
In those days some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.  
  
###### 28  
One of them named Agabus stood up and predicted through the Spirit that a great famine would sweep across the whole world. (This happened under Claudius.)  
  
###### 29  
So the disciples, each according to his ability, decided to send relief to the brothers living in Judea.  
  
###### 30  
This they did, sending their gifts to the elders with Barnabas and Saul.
