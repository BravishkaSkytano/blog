###### 1  
After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.  
  
###### 2  
There he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to visit them,  
  
###### 3  
and he stayed and worked with them because they were tentmakers by trade, just as he was.  
  
###### 4  
Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks alike.  
  
###### 5  
And when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself fully to the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.  
  
###### 6  
But when they opposed and insulted him, he shook out his garments and told them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”  
  
###### 7  
So Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titus Justus, a worshiper of God.  
  
###### 8  
Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his whole household believed in the Lord. And many of the Corinthians who heard the message believed and were baptized.  
  
###### 9  
One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: “Do not be afraid; keep on speaking; do not be silent.  
  
###### 10  
For I am with you and no one will lay a hand on you, because I have many people in this city.”  
  
###### 11  
So Paul stayed for a year and a half, teaching the word of God among the Corinthians.  
  
###### 12  
While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews coordinated an attack on Paul and brought him before the judgment seat.  
  
###### 13  
“This man is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law,” they said.  
  
###### 14  
But just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio told the Jews, “If this matter involved a wrongdoing or vicious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to hear your complaint.  
  
###### 15  
But since it is a dispute about words and names and your own law, settle it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of such things.”  
  
###### 16  
And he drove them away from the judgment seat.  
  
###### 17  
At this, the crowd seized Sosthenes the synagogue leader and beat him in front of the judgment seat. But none of this was of concern to Gallio.  
  
###### 18  
Paul remained in Corinth for quite some time before saying goodbye to the brothers. He had his head shaved in Cenchrea to keep a vow he had made, and then he sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila.  
  
###### 19  
When they reached Ephesus, Paul parted ways with Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue there and reasoned with the Jews.  
  
###### 20  
When they asked him to stay for a while longer, he declined.  
  
###### 21  
But as he left, he said, “I will come back to you if God is willing.” And he set sail from Ephesus.  
  
###### 22  
When Paul had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church at Jerusalem. Then he went down to Antioch.  
  
###### 23  
After Paul had spent some time in Antioch, he traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.  
  
###### 24  
Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, well versed in the Scriptures.  
  
###### 25  
He had been instructed in the way of the Lord and was fervent in spirit. He spoke and taught accurately about Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John.  
  
###### 26  
And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him in and explained to him the way of God more accurately.  
  
###### 27  
When Apollos resolved to cross over to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On his arrival, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed.  
  
###### 28  
For he powerfully refuted the Jews in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.
