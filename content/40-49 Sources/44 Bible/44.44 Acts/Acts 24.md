###### 1  
Five days later the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, who presented to the governor their case against Paul.  
  
###### 2  
When Paul had been called in, Tertullus opened the prosecution: “Because of you, we have enjoyed a lasting peace, and your foresight has brought improvements to this nation.  
  
###### 3  
In every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with all gratitude.  
  
###### 4  
But in order not to burden you any further, I beg your indulgence to hear us briefly.  
  
###### 5  
We have found this man to be a pestilence, stirring up dissension among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes,  
  
###### 6  
and he even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.  
  
###### 8  
By examining him yourself, you will be able to learn the truth about all our charges against him.”  
  
###### 9  
The Jews concurred, asserting that these charges were true.  
  
###### 10  
When the governor motioned for Paul to speak, he began his response: “Knowing that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I gladly make my defense.  
  
###### 11  
You can verify for yourself that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.  
  
###### 12  
Yet my accusers did not find me debating with anyone in the temple or riling up a crowd in the synagogues or in the city.  
  
###### 13  
Nor can they prove to you any of their charges against me.  
  
###### 14  
I do confess to you, however, that I worship the God of our fathers according to the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that is laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets,  
  
###### 15  
and I have the same hope in God that they themselves cherish, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.  
  
###### 16  
In this hope, I strive always to maintain a clear conscience before God and man.  
  
###### 17  
After several years, then, I returned to Jerusalem to bring alms to my people and to present offerings.  
  
###### 18  
At the time they found me in the temple, I was ceremonially clean and was not inciting a crowd or an uproar. But there are some Jews from the province of Asia  
  
###### 19  
who ought to appear before you and bring charges, if they have anything against me.  
  
###### 20  
Otherwise, let these men state for themselves any crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin,  
  
###### 21  
unless it was this one thing I called out as I stood in their presence: ‘It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’”  
  
###### 22  
Then Felix, who was well informed about the Way, adjourned the hearing and said, “When Lysias the commander comes, I will decide your case.”  
  
###### 23  
He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard, but to allow him some freedom and permit his friends to minister to his needs.  
  
###### 24  
After several days, Felix returned with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.  
  
###### 25  
As Paul expounded on righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became frightened and said, “You may go for now. When I find the time, I will call for you.”  
  
###### 26  
At the same time, he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe. So he sent for Paul frequently and talked with him.  
  
###### 27  
After two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. And wishing to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.
