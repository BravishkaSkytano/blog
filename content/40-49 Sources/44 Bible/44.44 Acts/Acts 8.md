###### 1  
And Saul was there, giving approval to Stephen’s death. On that day a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.  
  
###### 2  
God-fearing men buried Stephen and mourned deeply over him.  
  
###### 3  
But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison.  
  
###### 4  
Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.  
  
###### 5  
Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ to them.  
  
###### 6  
The crowds gave their undivided attention to Philip’s message and to the signs they saw him perform.  
  
###### 7  
With loud shrieks, unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, and many of the paralyzed and lame were healed.  
  
###### 8  
So there was great joy in that city.  
  
###### 9  
Prior to that time, a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and astounded the people of Samaria. He claimed to be someone great,  
  
###### 10  
and all the people, from the least to the greatest, heeded his words and said, “This man is the divine power called the Great Power.”  
  
###### 11  
They paid close attention to him because he had astounded them for a long time with his sorcery.  
  
###### 12  
But when they believed Philip as he preached the gospel of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.  
  
###### 13  
Even Simon himself believed and was baptized. He followed Philip closely and was astounded by the great signs and miracles he observed.  
  
###### 14  
When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.  
  
###### 15  
On their arrival, they prayed for them to receive the Holy Spirit.  
  
###### 16  
For the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.  
  
###### 17  
Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.  
  
###### 18  
When Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money.  
  
###### 19  
“Give me this power as well,” he said, “so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”  
  
###### 20  
But Peter replied, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money!  
  
###### 21  
You have no part or share in our ministry, because your heart is not right before God.  
  
###### 22  
Repent, therefore, of your wickedness, and pray to the Lord. Perhaps He will forgive you for the intent of your heart.  
  
###### 23  
For I see that you are poisoned by bitterness and captive to iniquity.”  
  
###### 24  
Then Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me, so that nothing you have said may happen to me.”  
  
###### 25  
And after Peter and John had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many of the Samaritan villages.  
  
###### 26  
Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go south to the desert road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.”  
  
###### 27  
So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official in charge of the entire treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. He had gone to Jerusalem to worship,  
  
###### 28  
and on his return was sitting in his chariot reading Isaiah the prophet.  
  
###### 29  
The Spirit said to Philip, “Go over to that chariot and stay by it.”  
  
###### 30  
So Philip ran up and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. “Do you understand what you are reading?” Philip asked.  
  
###### 31  
“How can I,” he said, “unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.  
  
###### 32  
The eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture: “He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, so He did not open His mouth.  
  
###### 33  
In His humiliation He was deprived of justice. Who can recount His descendants? For His life was removed from the earth.”  
  
###### 34  
“Tell me,” said the eunuch, “who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?”  
  
###### 35  
Then Philip began with this very Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.  
  
###### 36  
As they traveled along the road and came to some water, the eunuch said, “Look, here is water! What is there to prevent me from being baptized?”  
  
###### 38  
And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.  
  
###### 39  
When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, but went on his way rejoicing.  
  
###### 40  
But Philip appeared at Azotus and traveled through that region, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he came to Caesarea.
