###### 1  
This is the burden against Nineveh, the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:  
  
###### 2  
The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD is avenging and full of wrath. The LORD takes vengeance on His foes and reserves wrath for His enemies.  
  
###### 3  
The LORD is slow to anger and great in power; the LORD will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. His path is in the whirlwind and storm, and clouds are the dust beneath His feet.  
  
###### 4  
He rebukes the sea and dries it up; He makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither, and the flower of Lebanon wilts.  
  
###### 5  
The mountains quake before Him, and the hills melt away; the earth trembles at His presence—the world and all its dwellers.  
  
###### 6  
Who can withstand His indignation? Who can endure His burning anger? His wrath is poured out like fire; even rocks are shattered before Him.  
  
###### 7  
The LORD is good, a stronghold in the day of distress; He cares for those who trust in Him.  
  
###### 8  
But with an overwhelming flood He will make an end of Nineveh and pursue His enemies into darkness.  
  
###### 9  
Whatever you plot against the LORD, He will bring to an end. Affliction will not rise up a second time.  
  
###### 10  
For they will be entangled as with thorns and consumed like the drink of a drunkard—like stubble that is fully dry.  
  
###### 11  
From you, O Nineveh, comes forth a plotter of evil against the LORD, a counselor of wickedness.  
  
###### 12  
This is what the LORD says: “Though they are allied and numerous, yet they will be cut down and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, O Judah, I will afflict you no longer.  
  
###### 13  
For I will now break their yoke from your neck and tear away your shackles.”  
  
###### 14  
The LORD has issued a command concerning you, O Nineveh: “There will be no descendants to carry on your name. I will cut off the carved image and cast idol from the house of your gods; I will prepare your grave, for you are contemptible.”  
  
###### 15  
Look to the mountains—the feet of one who brings good news, who proclaims peace! Celebrate your feasts, O Judah; fulfill your vows. For the wicked will never again march through you; they will be utterly cut off.
