###### 12  
They made their hearts like flint and would not listen to the law or to the words that the LORD of Hosts had sent by His Spirit through the earlier prophets. Therefore great anger came from the LORD of Hosts.  
  
###### 13  
And just as I had called and they would not listen, so when they called I would not listen, says the LORD of Hosts.  
  
###### 14  
But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations that they had not known, and the land was left desolate behind them so that no one could come or go. Thus they turned the pleasant land into a desolation.”
