###### 1  
Then I lifted up my eyes and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.  
  
###### 2  
“Where are you going?” I asked. “To measure Jerusalem,” he replied, “and to determine its width and length.”  
  
###### 3  
Then the angel who was speaking with me went out, and another angel came out to meet him  
  
###### 4  
and said to him, “Run and tell that young man: ‘Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the multitude of men and livestock within it.  
  
###### 5  
For I will be a wall of fire around it, declares the LORD, and I will be the glory within it.’”  
  
###### 6  
“Get up! Get up! Flee from the land of the north,” declares the LORD, “for I have scattered you like the four winds of heaven,” declares the LORD.  
  
###### 7  
“Get up, O Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the Daughter of Babylon!”  
  
###### 8

###### 9  
I will surely wave My hand over them, so that they will become plunder for their own servants. Then you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me.”  
  
###### 10  
“Shout for joy and be glad, O Daughter of Zion, for I am coming to dwell among you,” declares the LORD.  
  
###### 11  
“On that day many nations will join themselves to the LORD, and they will become My people. I will dwell among you, and you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me to you.  
  
###### 12  
And the LORD will take possession of Judah as His portion in the Holy Land, and He will once again choose Jerusalem.  
  
###### 13  
Be silent before the LORD, all people, for He has roused Himself from His holy dwelling.”
