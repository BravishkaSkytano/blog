###### 1  
As dead flies bring a stench to the perfumer’s oil, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.  
  
###### 2  
A wise man’s heart inclines to the right, but the heart of a fool to the left.  
  
###### 3  
Even as the fool walks along the road, his sense is lacking, and he shows everyone that he is a fool.  
  
###### 4  
If the ruler’s temper flares against you, do not abandon your post, for calmness lays great offenses to rest.  
  
###### 5  
There is an evil I have seen under the sun—an error that proceeds from the ruler:  
  
###### 6  
Folly is appointed to great heights, but the rich sit in lowly positions.  
  
###### 7  
I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes go on foot like slaves.  
  
###### 8  
He who digs a pit may fall into it, and he who breaches a wall may be bitten by a snake.  
  
###### 9  
The one who quarries stones may be injured by them, and he who splits logs endangers himself.  
  
###### 10  
If the axe is dull and the blade unsharpened, more strength must be exerted, but skill produces success.  
  
###### 11  
If the snake bites before it is charmed, there is no profit for the charmer.  
  
###### 12  
The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious, but the lips of a fool consume him.  
  
###### 13  
The beginning of his talk is folly, and the end of his speech is evil madness.  
  
###### 14  
Yet the fool multiplies words. No one knows what is coming, and who can tell him what will come after him?  
  
###### 15  
The toil of a fool wearies him, for he does not know the way to the city.  
  
###### 16  
Woe to you, O land whose king is a youth, and whose princes feast in the morning.  
  
###### 17  
Blessed are you, O land whose king is a son of nobles, and whose princes feast at the proper time—for strength and not for drunkenness.  
  
###### 18  
Through laziness the roof caves in, and in the hands of the idle, the house leaks.  
  
###### 19  
A feast is prepared for laughter, and wine makes life merry, but money is the answer for everything.  
  
###### 20  
Do not curse the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich even in your bedroom, for a bird of the air may carry your words, and a winged creature may report your speech.
