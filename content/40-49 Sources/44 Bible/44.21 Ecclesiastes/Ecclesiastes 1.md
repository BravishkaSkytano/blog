###### 1  
These are the words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:  
  
###### 2  
“Futility of futilities,” says the Teacher, “futility of futilities! Everything is futile!”  
  
###### 3  
What does a man gain from all his labor, at which he toils under the sun?  
  
###### 4  
Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever.  
  
###### 5  
The sun rises and the sun sets; it hurries back to where it rises.  
  
###### 6  
The wind blows southward, then turns northward; round and round it swirls, ever returning on its course.  
  
###### 7  
All the rivers flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full; to the place from which the streams come, there again they flow.  
  
###### 8  
All things are wearisome, more than one can describe; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear content with hearing.  
  
###### 9  
What has been will be again, and what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.  
  
###### 10  
Is there a case where one can say, “Look, this is new”? It has already existed in the ages before us.  
  
###### 11  
There is no remembrance of those who came before, and those yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow after.  
  
###### 12  
I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.  
  
###### 13  
And I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid upon the sons of men to occupy them!  
  
###### 14  
I have seen all the things that are done under the sun, and have found them all to be futile, a pursuit of the wind.  
  
###### 15  
What is crooked cannot be straightened, and what is lacking cannot be counted.  
  
###### 16  
I said to myself, “Behold, I have grown and increased in wisdom beyond all those before me who were over Jerusalem, and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.”  
  
###### 17  
So I set my mind to know wisdom and madness and folly; I learned that this, too, is a pursuit of the wind.  
  
###### 18  
For with much wisdom comes much sorrow, and as knowledge grows, grief increases.
