###### 1  
There is another evil I have seen under the sun, and it weighs heavily upon mankind:  
  
###### 2  
God gives a man riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing his heart desires; but God does not allow him to enjoy them. Instead, a stranger will enjoy them. This is futile and a grievous affliction.  
  
###### 3  
A man may father a hundred children and live for many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he is unsatisfied with his prosperity and does not even receive a proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.  
  
###### 4  
For a stillborn child enters in futility and departs in darkness, and his name is shrouded in obscurity.  
  
###### 5  
The child, though neither seeing the sun nor knowing anything, has more rest than that man,  
  
###### 6  
even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?  
  
###### 7  
All a man’s labor is for his mouth, yet his appetite is never satisfied.  
  
###### 8  
What advantage, then, has the wise man over the fool? What gain comes to the poor man who knows how to conduct himself before others?  
  
###### 9  
Better what the eye can see than the wandering of desire. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.  
  
###### 10  
Whatever exists was named long ago, and what happens to a man is foreknown; but he cannot contend with one stronger than he.  
  
###### 11  
For the more words, the more futility—and how does that profit anyone?  
  
###### 12  
For who knows what is good for a man during the few days in which he passes through his fleeting life like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will come after him under the sun?
