###### 1  
Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him.  
  
###### 2  
When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God.” So he named that place Mahanaim.  
  
###### 3  
Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.  
  
###### 4  
He instructed them, “You are to say to my master Esau, ‘Your servant Jacob says: I have been staying with Laban and have remained there until now.  
  
###### 5  
I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, menservants, and maidservants. I have sent this message to inform my master, so that I may find favor in your sight.’”  
  
###### 6  
When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you—he and four hundred men with him.”  
  
###### 7  
In great fear and distress, Jacob divided his people into two camps, as well as the flocks and herds and camels.  
  
###### 8  
He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one camp, then the other camp can escape.”  
  
###### 9  
Then Jacob declared, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, the LORD who told me, ‘Go back to your country and to your kindred, and I will make you prosper,’  
  
###### 10  
I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness You have shown Your servant. Indeed, with only my staff I came across the Jordan, but now I have become two camps.  
  
###### 11  
Please deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid that he may come and attack me and the mothers and children with me.  
  
###### 12  
But You have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper, and I will make your offspring like the sand of the sea, too numerous to count.’”  
  
###### 13  
Jacob spent the night there, and from what he had brought with him, he selected a gift for his brother Esau:  
  
###### 14  
200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams,  
  
###### 15  
30 milk camels with their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys, and 10 male donkeys.  
  
###### 16  
He entrusted them to his servants in separate herds and told them, “Go on ahead of me, and keep some distance between the herds.”  
  
###### 17  
He instructed the one in the lead, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘To whom do you belong, where are you going, and whose animals are these before you?’  
  
###### 18  
then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift, sent to my lord Esau. And behold, Jacob is behind us.’”  
  
###### 19  
He also instructed the second, the third, and all those following behind the herds: “When you meet Esau, you are to say the same thing to him.  
  
###### 20  
You are also to say, ‘Look, your servant Jacob is right behind us.’” For he thought, “I will appease Esau with the gift that is going before me. After that I can face him, and perhaps he will accept me.”  
  
###### 21  
So Jacob’s gifts went on before him, while he spent the night in the camp.  
  
###### 22  
During the night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.  
  
###### 23  
He took them and sent them across the stream, along with all his possessions.  
  
###### 24  
So Jacob was left all alone, and there a man wrestled with him until daybreak.  
  
###### 25  
When the man saw that he could not overpower Jacob, he struck the socket of Jacob’s hip and dislocated it as they wrestled.  
  
###### 26  
Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.” But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”  
  
###### 27  
“What is your name?” the man asked. “Jacob,” he replied.  
  
###### 28  
Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men, and you have prevailed.”  
  
###### 29  
And Jacob requested, “Please tell me your name.” But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed Jacob there.  
  
###### 30  
So Jacob named the place Peniel, saying, “Indeed, I have seen God face to face, and yet my life was spared.”  
  
###### 31  
The sun rose above him as he passed by Penuel, and he was limping because of his hip.  
  
###### 32  
Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon which is at the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob’s hip was struck near that tendon.
