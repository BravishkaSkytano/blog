###### 8  
Cush was the father of Nimrod, who began to be a mighty one on the earth.  
  
###### 9  
He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; so it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD.”

###### 11

and the borders of Canaan extended from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.  
  
###### 20  
These are the sons of Ham according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations.

###### 25  
Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg, because in his days the earth was divided, and his brother was named Joktan.

###### 32  
All these are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their generations and nations. From these the nations of the earth spread out after the flood.
