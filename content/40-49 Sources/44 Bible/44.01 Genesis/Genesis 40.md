###### 1  
Some time later, the king’s cupbearer and baker offended their master, the king of Egypt.  
  
###### 2  
Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,  
  
###### 3  
and imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard, the same prison where Joseph was confined.  
  
###### 4  
The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he became their personal attendant. After they had been in custody for some time,  
  
###### 5  
both of these men—the Egyptian king’s cupbearer and baker, who were being held in the prison—had a dream on the same night, and each dream had its own meaning.  
  
###### 6  
When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were distraught.  
  
###### 7  
So he asked the officials of Pharaoh who were in custody with him in his master’s house, “Why are your faces so downcast today?”  
  
###### 8  
“We both had dreams,” they replied, “but there is no one to interpret them.” Then Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.”  
  
###### 9  
So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream: “In my dream there was a vine before me,  
  
###### 10  
and on the vine were three branches. As it budded, its blossoms opened and its clusters ripened into grapes.  
  
###### 11  
Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into his cup, and placed the cup in his hand.”  
  
###### 12  
Joseph replied, “This is the interpretation: The three branches are three days.  
  
###### 13  
Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore your position. You will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you did when you were his cupbearer.  
  
###### 14  
But when it goes well for you, please remember me and show me kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh, that he might bring me out of this prison.  
  
###### 15  
For I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing for which they should have put me in this dungeon.”  
  
###### 16  
When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I too had a dream: There were three baskets of white bread on my head.  
  
###### 17  
In the top basket were all sorts of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”  
  
###### 18  
Joseph replied, “This is the interpretation: The three baskets are three days.  
  
###### 19  
Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and hang you on a tree. Then the birds will eat the flesh of your body.”  
  
###### 20  
On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he held a feast for all his officials, and in their presence he lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.  
  
###### 21  
Pharaoh restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.  
  
###### 22  
But Pharaoh hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had described to them in his interpretation.  
  
###### 23  
The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot all about him.
