###### 1  
Now Abraham journeyed from there to the region of the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he was staying in Gerar,  
  
###### 2  
Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” So Abimelech king of Gerar had Sarah brought to him.  
  
###### 3  
One night, however, God came to Abimelech in a dream and told him, “You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken, for she is a married woman.”  
  
###### 4  
Now Abimelech had not gone near her, so he replied, “Lord, would You destroy a nation even though it is innocent?  
  
###### 5  
Didn’t Abraham tell me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.”  
  
###### 6  
Then God said to Abimelech in the dream, “Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against Me. That is why I did not let you touch her.  
  
###### 7  
Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet; he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not restore her, be aware that you will surely die—you and all who belong to you.”  
  
###### 8  
Early the next morning Abimelech got up and summoned all his servants; and when he described to them all that had happened, the men were terrified.  
  
###### 9  
Then Abimelech called Abraham and asked, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought such tremendous guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done.”  
  
###### 10  
Abimelech also asked Abraham, “What prompted you to do such a thing?”  
  
###### 11  
Abraham replied, “I thought to myself, ‘Surely there is no fear of God in this place. They will kill me on account of my wife.’  
  
###### 12  
Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father—though not the daughter of my mother—and she became my wife.  
  
###### 13  
So when God had me journey from my father’s house, I said to Sarah, ‘This is how you can show your loyalty to me: Wherever we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”  
  
###### 14  
So Abimelech brought sheep and cattle, menservants and maidservants, and he gave them to Abraham and restored his wife Sarah to him.  
  
###### 15  
And Abimelech said, “Look, my land is before you. Settle wherever you please.”  
  
###### 16  
And he said to Sarah, “See, I am giving your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is your vindication before all who are with you; you are completely cleared.”  
  
###### 17  
Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maidservants, so that they could again bear children—  
  
###### 18  
for on account of Abraham’s wife Sarah, the LORD had completely closed all the wombs in Abimelech’s household.
