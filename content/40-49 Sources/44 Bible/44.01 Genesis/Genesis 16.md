###### 1  
Now Abram’s wife Sarai had borne him no children, but she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar.  
  
###### 2  
So Sarai said to Abram, “Look now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Please go to my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family by her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.  
  
###### 3  
So after he had lived in Canaan for ten years, his wife Sarai took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to Abram to be his wife.  
  
###### 4  
And he slept with Hagar, and she conceived. But when Hagar realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.  
  
###### 5  
Then Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be upon you! I delivered my servant into your arms, and ever since she saw that she was pregnant, she has treated me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me.”  
  
###### 6  
“Here,” said Abram, “your servant is in your hands. Do whatever you want with her.” Then Sarai treated Hagar so harshly that she fled from her.  
  
###### 7  
Now the angel of the LORD found Hagar by a spring of water in the desert—the spring along the road to Shur.  
  
###### 8  
“Hagar, servant of Sarai,” he said, “where have you come from, and where are you going?” “I am running away from my mistress Sarai,” she replied.  
  
###### 9  
So the angel of the LORD told her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her authority.”  
  
###### 10  
Then the angel added, “I will greatly multiply your offspring so that they will be too numerous to count.”  
  
###### 11  
The angel of the LORD proceeded: “Behold, you have conceived and will bear a son. And you shall name him Ishmael, for the LORD has heard your cry of affliction.  
  
###### 12  
He will be a wild donkey of a man, and his hand will be against everyone, and everyone’s hand against him; he will live in hostility toward all his brothers.”  
  
###### 13  
So Hagar gave this name to the LORD who had spoken to her: “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “Here I have seen the One who sees me!”  
  
###### 14  
Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi. It is located between Kadesh and Bered.  
  
###### 15  
And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.  
  
###### 16  
Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.
