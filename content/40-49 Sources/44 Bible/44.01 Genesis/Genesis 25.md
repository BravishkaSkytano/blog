###### 1  
Now Abraham had taken another wife, named Keturah,  
  
###### 2  
and she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.  
  
###### 3  
Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites, and the Leummites.  
  
###### 4  
The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.  
  
###### 5  
Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.  
  
###### 6  
But while he was still alive, Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.  
  
###### 7  
Abraham lived a total of 175 years.  
  
###### 8  
And at a ripe old age he breathed his last and died, old and contented, and was gathered to his people.  
  
###### 9  
His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite.  
  
###### 10  
This was the field that Abraham had bought from the Hittites. Abraham was buried there with his wife Sarah.  
  
###### 11  
After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who lived near Beer-lahai-roi.  
  
###### 12  
This is the account of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham.  
  
###### 13  
These are the names of the sons of Ishmael in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,  
  
###### 14  
Mishma, Dumah, Massa,  
  
###### 15  
Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.  
  
###### 16  
These were the sons of Ishmael, and these were their names by their villages and encampments—twelve princes of their tribes.  
  
###### 17  
Ishmael lived a total of 137 years. Then he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.  
  
###### 18  
Ishmael’s descendants settled from Havilah to Shur, which is near the border of Egypt as you go toward Asshur. And they lived in hostility toward all their brothers.  
  
###### 19  
This is the account of Abraham’s son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac,  
  
###### 20  
and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan-aram and the sister of Laban the Aramean.  
  
###### 21  
Later, Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD heard his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived.  
  
###### 22  
But the children inside her struggled with each other, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So Rebekah went to inquire of the LORD,  
  
###### 23  
and He declared to her: “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.”  
  
###### 24  
When her time came to give birth, there were indeed twins in her womb.  
  
###### 25  
The first one came out red, covered with hair like a fur coat; so they named him Esau.  
  
###### 26  
After this, his brother came out grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born.  
  
###### 27  
When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man who stayed at home.  
  
###### 28  
Because Isaac had a taste for wild game, he loved Esau; but Rebekah loved Jacob.  
  
###### 29  
One day, while Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the field and was famished.  
  
###### 30  
He said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am famished.” (That is why he was also called Edom.)  
  
###### 31  
“First sell me your birthright,” Jacob replied.  
  
###### 32  
“Look,” said Esau, “I am about to die, so what good is a birthright to me?”  
  
###### 33  
“Swear to me first,” Jacob said. So Esau swore to Jacob and sold him the birthright.  
  
###### 34  
Then Jacob gave some bread and lentil stew to Esau, who ate and drank and then got up and went away. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
