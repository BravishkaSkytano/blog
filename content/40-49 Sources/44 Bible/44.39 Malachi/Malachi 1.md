but Esau I have hated, and I have made his mountains a wasteland and left his inheritance to the desert jackals.”  
  
###### 4  
Though Edom may say, “We have been devastated, but we will rebuild the ruins,” this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Land of Wickedness, and a people with whom the LORD is indignant forever.  
  
###### 5
