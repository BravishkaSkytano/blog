###### 1  
Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead—  
  
###### 2  
and all the brothers with me, To the churches of Galatia:  
  
###### 3  
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,  
  
###### 4  
who gave Himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,  
  
###### 5  
to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.  
  
###### 6  
I am amazed how quickly you are deserting the One who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—  
  
###### 7  
which is not even a gospel. Evidently some people are troubling you and trying to distort the gospel of Christ.  
  
###### 8  
But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be under a curse!  
  
###### 9  
As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be under a curse!  
  
###### 10  
Am I now seeking the approval of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.  
  
###### 11  
For I certify to you, brothers, that the gospel I preached was not devised by man.  
  
###### 12  
I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.  
  
###### 13  
For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how severely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.  
  
###### 14  
I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.  
  
###### 15  
But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by His grace, was pleased  
  
###### 16  
to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not rush to consult with flesh and blood,  
  
###### 17  
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to the apostles who came before me, but I went into Arabia and later returned to Damascus.  
  
###### 18  
Only after three years did I go up to Jerusalem to confer with Cephas, and I stayed with him fifteen days.  
  
###### 19  
But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord’s brother.  
  
###### 20  
I assure you before God that what I am writing to you is no lie.  
  
###### 21  
Later I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.  
  
###### 22  
I was personally unknown, however, to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.  
  
###### 23  
They only heard the account: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.”  
  
###### 24  
And they glorified God because of me.
