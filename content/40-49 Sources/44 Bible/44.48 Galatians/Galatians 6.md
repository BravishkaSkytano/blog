###### 1  
Brothers, if someone is caught in a trespass, you who are spiritual should restore him with a spirit of gentleness. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.  
  
###### 2  
Carry one another’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.  
  
###### 3  
If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.  
  
###### 4  
Each one should test his own work. Then he will have reason to boast in himself alone, and not in someone else.  
  
###### 5  
For each one should carry his own load.  
  
###### 6  
Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word must share in all good things with his instructor.  
  
###### 7  
Do not be deceived: God is not to be mocked. Whatever a man sows, he will reap in return.  
  
###### 8  
The one who sows to please his flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; but the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.  
  
###### 9  
Let us not grow weary in well-doing, for in due time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.  
  
###### 10  
Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to the family of faith.  
  
###### 11  
See what large letters I am using to write to you with my own hand!  
  
###### 12  
Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. They only do this to avoid persecution for the cross of Christ.  
  
###### 13  
For the circumcised do not even keep the law themselves, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.  
  
###### 14  
But as for me, may I never boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.  
  
###### 15  
For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything. What counts is a new creation.  
  
###### 16  
Peace and mercy to all who walk by this rule, even to the Israel of God.  
  
###### 17  
From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.  
  
###### 18  
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
