###### 1  
Put the ram’s horn to your lips! An eagle looms over the house of the LORD, because the people have transgressed My covenant and rebelled against My law.  
  
###### 2  
Israel cries out to Me, “O our God, we know You!”  
  
###### 3  
But Israel has rejected good; an enemy will pursue him.  
  
###### 4  
They set up kings, but not by Me. They make princes, but without My approval. With their silver and gold they make themselves idols, to their own destruction.  
  
###### 5  
He has rejected your calf, O Samaria. My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of innocence?  
  
###### 6  
For this thing is from Israel—a craftsman made it, and it is not God. It will be broken to pieces, that calf of Samaria.  
  
###### 7  
For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind. There is no standing grain; what sprouts fails to yield flour. Even if it should produce, the foreigners would swallow it up.  
  
###### 8  
Israel is swallowed up! Now they are among the nations like a worthless vessel.  
  
###### 9  
For they have gone up to Assyria like a wild donkey on its own. Ephraim has hired lovers.  
  
###### 10  
Though they hire allies among the nations, I will now round them up, and they will begin to diminish under the oppression of the king of princes.  
  
###### 11  
Though Ephraim multiplied the altars for sin, they became his altars for sinning.  
  
###### 12  
Though I wrote for them the great things of My law, they regarded them as something strange.  
  
###### 13  
Though they offer sacrifices as gifts to Me, and though they eat the meat, the LORD does not accept them. Now He will remember their iniquity and punish their sins: They will return to Egypt.  
  
###### 14  
Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; Judah has multiplied its fortified cities. But I will send fire upon their cities, and it will consume their citadels.
