###### 1  
Israel was a luxuriant vine, yielding fruit for himself. The more his fruit increased, the more he increased the altars. The better his land produced, the better he made the sacred pillars.  
  
###### 2  
Their hearts are devious; now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will break down their altars and demolish their sacred pillars.  
  
###### 3  
Surely now they will say, “We have no king, for we do not revere the LORD. What can a king do for us?”  
  
###### 4  
They speak mere words; with false oaths they make covenants. So judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field.  
  
###### 5  
The people of Samaria will fear for the calf of Beth-aven. Indeed, its people will mourn with its idolatrous priests—those who rejoiced in its glory—for it has been taken from them into exile.  
  
###### 6  
Yes, it will be carried to Assyria as tribute to the great king. Ephraim will be seized with shame; Israel will be ashamed of its wooden idols.  
  
###### 7  
Samaria will be carried off with her king like a twig on the surface of the water.  
  
###### 8  
The high places of Aven will be destroyed—it is the sin of Israel; thorns and thistles will overgrow their altars. Then they will say to the mountains, “Cover us!” and to the hills, “Fall on us!”  
  
###### 9  
Since the days of Gibeah you have sinned, O Israel, and there you have remained. Did not the battle in Gibeah overtake the sons of iniquity?  
  
###### 10  
I will chasten them when I please; nations will be gathered against them to put them in bondage for their double transgression.  
  
###### 11  
Ephraim is a well-trained heifer that loves to thresh; but I will place a yoke on her fair neck. I will harness Ephraim, Judah will plow, and Jacob will break the hard ground.  
  
###### 12  
Sow for yourselves righteousness and reap the fruit of loving devotion; break up your unplowed ground. For it is time to seek the LORD until He comes and sends righteousness upon you like rain.  
  
###### 13  
You have plowed wickedness and reaped injustice; you have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your own way and in the multitude of your mighty men,  
  
###### 14  
the roar of battle will rise against your people, so that all your fortresses will be demolished as Shalman devastated Beth-arbel in the day of battle, when mothers were dashed to pieces along with their children.  
  
###### 15  
Thus it will be done to you, O Bethel, because of your great wickedness. When the day dawns, the king of Israel will be utterly cut off.
