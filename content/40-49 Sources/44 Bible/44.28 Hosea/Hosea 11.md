###### 1  
When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son.  
  
###### 2  
But the more I called Israel, the farther they departed from Me. They sacrificed to the Baals and burned incense to carved images.  
  
###### 3  
It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them in My arms, but they never realized that it was I who healed them.  
  
###### 4  
I led them with cords of kindness, with ropes of love; I lifted the yoke from their necks and bent down to feed them.  
  
###### 5  
Will they not return to the land of Egypt and be ruled by Assyria because they refused to repent?  
  
###### 6  
A sword will flash through their cities; it will destroy the bars of their gates and consume them in their own plans.  
  
###### 7  
My people are bent on turning from Me. Though they call to the Most High, He will by no means exalt them.  
  
###### 8  
How could I give you up, O Ephraim? How could I surrender you, O Israel? How could I make you like Admah? How could I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart is turned within Me; My compassion is stirred!  
  
###### 9  
I will not execute the full fury of My anger; I will not turn back to destroy Ephraim. For I am God and not man—the Holy One among you—and I will not come in wrath.  
  
###### 10  
They will walk after the LORD; He will roar like a lion. When He roars, His children will come trembling from the west.  
  
###### 11  
They will come trembling like birds from Egypt and like doves from the land of Assyria. Then I will settle them in their homes, declares the LORD.  
  
###### 12  
Ephraim surrounds Me with lies, the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah still walks with God and is faithful to the Holy One.
