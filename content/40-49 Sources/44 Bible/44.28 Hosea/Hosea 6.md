###### 1  
Come, let us return to the LORD. For He has torn us to pieces, but He will heal us; He has wounded us, but He will bind up our wounds.  
  
###### 2  
After two days He will revive us; on the third day He will raise us up, that we may live in His presence.  
  
###### 3  
So let us know—let us press on to know the LORD. As surely as the sun rises, He will appear; He will come to us like the rain, like the spring showers that water the earth.  
  
###### 4  
What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah? For your loyalty is like a morning mist, like the early dew that vanishes.  
  
###### 5  
Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of My mouth, and My judgments go forth like lightning.  
  
###### 6  
For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.  
  
###### 7  
But they, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant; there they were unfaithful to Me.  
  
###### 8  
Gilead is a city of evildoers, tracked with footprints of blood.  
  
###### 9  
Like raiders who lie in ambush, so does a band of priests; they murder on the way to Shechem; surely they have committed atrocities.  
  
###### 10  
In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: Ephraim practices prostitution there, and Israel is defiled.  
  
###### 11  
Also for you, O Judah, a harvest is appointed, when I restore My people from captivity.
