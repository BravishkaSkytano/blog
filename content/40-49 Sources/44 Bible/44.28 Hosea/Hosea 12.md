###### 1  
Ephraim chases the wind and pursues the east wind all day long; he multiplies lies and violence; he makes a covenant with Assyria and sends olive oil to Egypt.  
  
###### 2  
The LORD also brings a charge against Judah. He will punish Jacob according to his ways and repay him according to his deeds.  
  
###### 3  
In the womb he grasped his brother’s heel, and in his vigor he wrestled with God.  
  
###### 4  
Yes, he struggled with the angel and prevailed; he wept and sought His favor; he found Him at Bethel and spoke with Him there—  
  
###### 5  
the LORD is the God of Hosts—the LORD is His name of renown.  
  
###### 6  
But you must return to your God, maintaining love and justice, and always waiting on your God.  
  
###### 7  
A merchant loves to defraud with dishonest scales in his hands.  
  
###### 8  
And Ephraim boasts: “How rich I have become! I have found wealth for myself. In all my labors, they can find in me no iniquity that is sinful.”  
  
###### 9  
But I am the LORD your God ever since the land of Egypt. I will again make you dwell in tents, as in the days of the appointed feast.  
  
###### 10  
I spoke through the prophets and multiplied their visions; I gave parables through the prophets.  
  
###### 11  
Is there iniquity in Gilead? They will surely come to nothing. Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal? Indeed, their altars will be heaps of stones in the furrows of the field.  
  
###### 12  
Jacob fled to the land of Aram and Israel worked for a wife—for a wife he tended sheep.  
  
###### 13  
But by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved.  
  
###### 14  
Ephraim has provoked bitter anger, so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt upon him and repay him for his contempt.
