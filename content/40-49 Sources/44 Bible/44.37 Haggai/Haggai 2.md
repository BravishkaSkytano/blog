###### 1  
On the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet, saying:  
  
###### 2  
“Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and also to the remnant of the people. Ask them,  
  
###### 3  
‘Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Does it not appear to you like nothing in comparison?’  
  
###### 4  
But now be strong, O Zerubbabel, declares the LORD. Be strong, O Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. And be strong, all you people of the land, declares the LORD. Work! For I am with you, declares the LORD of Hosts.  
  
###### 5  
This is the promise I made to you when you came out of Egypt. And My Spirit remains among you; do not be afraid.”  
  
###### 6  
For this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Once more, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land.  
  
###### 7  
I will shake all the nations, and they will come with all their treasures, and I will fill this house with glory, says the LORD of Hosts.  
  
###### 8  
The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, declares the LORD of Hosts.  
  
###### 9  
The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former, says the LORD of Hosts. And in this place I will provide peace, declares the LORD of Hosts.”  
  
###### 10  
On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Haggai the prophet, saying,  
  
###### 11  
“This is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘Ask the priests for a ruling.  
  
###### 12  
If a man carries consecrated meat in the fold of his garment, and it touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any other food, does that item become holy?’” “No,” replied the priests.  
  
###### 13  
So Haggai asked, “If one who is defiled by contact with a corpse touches any of these, does it become defiled?” “Yes, it becomes defiled,” the priests answered.  
  
###### 14  
Then Haggai replied, “So it is with this people and this nation before Me, declares the LORD, and so it is with every work of their hands; whatever they offer there is defiled.  
  
###### 15  
Now consider carefully from this day forward: Before one stone was placed on another in the temple of the LORD,  
  
###### 16  
from that time, when one came expecting a heap of twenty ephahs of grain, there were but ten. When one came to the winepress to draw out fifty baths, there were but twenty.  
  
###### 17  
I struck you—all the work of your hands—with blight, mildew, and hail, but you did not turn to Me, declares the LORD.  
  
###### 18  
Consider carefully from this day forward—from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, the day the foundation of the LORD’s temple was laid—consider carefully:  
  
###### 19  
Is there still seed in the barn? The vine, the fig, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not yet yielded fruit. But from this day on, I will bless you.”  
  
###### 20  
For the second time that day, the twenty-fourth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to Haggai, saying,  
  
###### 21  
“Tell Zerubbabel governor of Judah that I am about to shake the heavens and the earth:  
  
###### 22  
I will overturn royal thrones and destroy the power of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overturn chariots and their riders; horses and their riders will fall, each by the sword of his brother.  
  
###### 23  
On that day, declares the LORD of Hosts, I will take you, My servant, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, declares the LORD, and I will make you like My signet ring, for I have chosen you, declares the LORD of Hosts.”
