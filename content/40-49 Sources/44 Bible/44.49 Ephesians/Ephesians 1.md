###### 1  
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus:  
  
###### 2  
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  
  
###### 3  
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms.  
  
###### 4  
For He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless in His presence. In love  
  
###### 5  
He predestined us for adoption as His sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His will,  
  
###### 6  
to the praise of His glorious grace, which He has freely given us in the Beloved One.  
  
###### 7  
In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace  
  
###### 8  
that He lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding.  
  
###### 9  
And He has made known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Christ  
  
###### 10  
as a plan for the fullness of time, to bring all things in heaven and on earth together in Christ.  
  
###### 11  
In Him we were also chosen as God’s own, having been predestined according to the plan of Him who works out everything by the counsel of His will,  
  
###### 12  
in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, would be for the praise of His glory.  
  
###### 13  
And in Him, having heard and believed the word of truth—the gospel of your salvation—you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,  
  
###### 14  
who is the pledge of our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession, to the praise of His glory.  
  
###### 15  
For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,  
  
###### 16  
I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers,  
  
###### 17  
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in your knowledge of Him.  
  
###### 18  
I ask that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you may know the hope of His calling, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints,  
  
###### 19  
and the surpassing greatness of His power to us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of His mighty strength,  
  
###### 20  
which He exerted in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly realms,  
  
###### 21  
far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.  
  
###### 22  
And God put everything under His feet and made Him head over everything for the church,  
  
###### 23  
which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.
