###### 1  
Be imitators of God, therefore, as beloved children,  
  
###### 2  
and walk in love, just as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us as a fragrant sacrificial offering to God.  
  
###### 3  
But among you, as is proper among the saints, there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed.  
  
###### 4  
Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk, or crude joking, which are out of character, but rather thanksgiving.  
  
###### 5  
For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure, or greedy person (that is, an idolater), has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.  
  
###### 6  
Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience.  
  
###### 7  
Therefore do not be partakers with them.  
  
###### 8  
For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,  
  
###### 9  
for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth.  
  
###### 10  
Test and prove what pleases the Lord.  
  
###### 11  
Have no fellowship with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.  
  
###### 12  
For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.  
  
###### 13  
But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, for everything that is illuminated becomes a light itself.  
  
###### 14  
So it is said: “Wake up, O sleeper, rise up from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”  
  
###### 15  
Pay careful attention, then, to how you walk, not as unwise but as wise,  
  
###### 16  
redeeming the time, because the days are evil.  
  
###### 17  
Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is.  
  
###### 18  
Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to reckless indiscretion. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.  
  
###### 19  
Speak to one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord,  
  
###### 20  
always giving thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
  
###### 21  
Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.  
  
###### 22  
Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.  
  
###### 23  
For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, His body, of which He is the Savior.  
  
###### 24  
Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.  
  
###### 25  
Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her  
  
###### 26  
to sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,  
  
###### 27  
and to present her to Himself as a glorious church, without stain or wrinkle or any such blemish, but holy and blameless.  
  
###### 28  
In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.  
  
###### 29  
Indeed, no one ever hated his own body, but he nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church.  
  
###### 30  
For we are members of His body.  
  
###### 31  
“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”  
  
###### 32  
This mystery is profound, but I am speaking about Christ and the church.  
  
###### 33  
Nevertheless, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
