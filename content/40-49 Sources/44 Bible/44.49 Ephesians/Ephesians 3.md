###### 1  
For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles...  
  
###### 2  
Surely you have heard about the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you,  
  
###### 3  
that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly.  
  
###### 4  
In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,  
  
###### 5  
which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets.  
  
###### 6  
This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus.  
  
###### 7  
I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace, given me through the working of His power.  
  
###### 8  
Though I am less than the least of all the saints, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,  
  
###### 9  
and to illuminate for everyone the stewardship of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.  
  
###### 10  
His purpose was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,  
  
###### 11  
according to the eternal purpose that He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.  
  
###### 12  
In Him and through faith in Him we may enter God’s presence with boldness and confidence.  
  
###### 13  
So I ask you not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.  
  
###### 14  
... for this reason I bow my knees before the Father,  
  
###### 15  
from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name.  
  
###### 16  
I ask that out of the riches of His glory He may strengthen you with power through His Spirit in your inner being,  
  
###### 17  
so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. Then you, being rooted and grounded in love,  
  
###### 18  
will have power, together with all the saints, to comprehend the length and width and height and depth  
  
###### 19  
of the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.  
  
###### 20  
Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to His power that is at work within us,  
  
###### 21  
to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
