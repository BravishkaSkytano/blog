###### 1  
Now about the collection for the saints, you are to do as I directed the churches of Galatia:  
  
###### 2  
On the first day of every week, each of you should set aside a portion of his income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will be needed.  
  
###### 3  
Then, on my arrival, I will send letters with those you recommend to carry your gift to Jerusalem.  
  
###### 4  
And if it is advisable for me to go also, they can travel with me.  
  
###### 5  
After I go through Macedonia, however, I will come to you; for I will be going through Macedonia.  
  
###### 6  
Perhaps I will stay with you awhile, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go.  
  
###### 7  
For I do not want to see you now only in passing; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.  
  
###### 8  
But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,  
  
###### 9  
because a great door for effective work has opened to me, even though many oppose me.  
  
###### 10  
If Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is doing the work of the Lord, just as I am.  
  
###### 11  
No one, then, should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he can return to me, for I am expecting him along with the brothers.  
  
###### 12  
Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was not at all inclined to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity.  
  
###### 13  
Be on the alert. Stand firm in the faith. Be men of courage. Be strong.  
  
###### 14  
Do everything in love.  
  
###### 15  
You know that Stephanas and his household were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints. Now I urge you, brothers,  
  
###### 16  
to submit to such as these, and to every fellow worker and laborer.  
  
###### 17  
I am glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus have arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.  
  
###### 18  
For they refreshed my spirit and yours as well. Show your appreciation, therefore, to such men.  
  
###### 19  
The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house.  
  
###### 20  
All the brothers here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.  
  
###### 21  
This greeting is in my own hand—Paul.  
  
###### 22  
If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be under a curse. Come, O Lord!  
  
###### 23  
The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.  
  
###### 24  
My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
