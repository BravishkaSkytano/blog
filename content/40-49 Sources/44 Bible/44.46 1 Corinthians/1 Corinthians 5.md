###### 1  
It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is intolerable even among pagans: A man has his father’s wife.  
  
###### 2  
And you are proud! Shouldn’t you rather have been stricken with grief and have removed from your fellowship the man who did this?  
  
###### 3  
Although I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit, and I have already pronounced judgment on the one who did this, just as if I were present.  
  
###### 4  
When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit, along with the power of the Lord Jesus,  
  
###### 5  
hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the Day of the Lord.  
  
###### 6  
Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven works through the whole batch of dough?  
  
###### 7  
Get rid of the old leaven, that you may be a new unleavened batch, as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.  
  
###### 8  
Therefore let us keep the feast, not with the old bread, leavened with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and of truth.  
  
###### 9  
I wrote you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.  
  
###### 10  
I was not including the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.  
  
###### 11  
But now I am writing you not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a verbal abuser, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat.  
  
###### 12  
What business of mine is it to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?  
  
###### 13  
God will judge those outside. “Expel the wicked man from among you.”
