###### 1  
If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a ringing gong or a clanging cymbal.  
  
###### 2  
If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have absolute faith so as to move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.  
  
###### 3  
If I give all I possess to the poor and exult in the surrender of my body, but have not love, I gain nothing.  
  
###### 4  
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.  
  
###### 5  
It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no account of wrongs.  
  
###### 6  
Love takes no pleasure in evil, but rejoices in the truth.  
  
###### 7  
It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.  
  
###### 8  
Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be restrained; where there is knowledge, it will be dismissed.  
  
###### 9  
For we know in part and we prophesy in part,  
  
###### 10  
but when the perfect comes, the partial passes away.  
  
###### 11  
When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I set aside childish ways.  
  
###### 12  
Now we see but a dim reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.  
  
###### 13  
And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love; but the greatest of these is love.
