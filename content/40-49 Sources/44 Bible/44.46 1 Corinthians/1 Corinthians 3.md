###### 1  
Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual, but as worldly—as infants in Christ.  
  
###### 2  
I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for solid food. In fact, you are still not ready,  
  
###### 3  
for you are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and dissension among you, are you not worldly? Are you not walking in the way of man?  
  
###### 4  
For when one of you says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not mere men?  
  
###### 5  
What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? They are servants through whom you believed, as the Lord has assigned to each his role.  
  
###### 6  
I planted the seed and Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.  
  
###### 7  
So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.  
  
###### 8  
He who plants and he who waters are one in purpose, and each will be rewarded according to his own labor.  
  
###### 9  
For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.  
  
###### 10  
By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one must be careful how he builds.  
  
###### 11  
For no one can lay a foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.  
  
###### 12  
If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,  
  
###### 13  
his workmanship will be evident, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will prove the quality of each man’s work.  
  
###### 14  
If what he has built survives, he will receive a reward.  
  
###### 15  
If it is burned up, he will suffer loss. He himself will be saved, but only as if through the flames.  
  
###### 16  
Do you not know that you yourselves are God’s temple, and that God’s Spirit dwells in you?  
  
###### 17  
If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple.  
  
###### 18  
Let no one deceive himself. If any of you thinks he is wise in this age, he should become a fool, so that he may become wise.  
  
###### 19  
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness.”  
  
###### 20  
And again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.”  
  
###### 21  
Therefore, stop boasting in men. All things are yours,  
  
###### 22  
whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future. All of them belong to you,  
  
###### 23  
and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
