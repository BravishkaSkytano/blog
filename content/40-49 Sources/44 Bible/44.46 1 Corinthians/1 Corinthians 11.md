###### 1  
You are to imitate me, just as I imitate Christ.  
  
###### 2  
Now I commend you for remembering me in everything and for maintaining the traditions, just as I passed them on to you.  
  
###### 3  
But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.  
  
###### 4  
Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.  
  
###### 5  
And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, for it is just as if her head were shaved.  
  
###### 6  
If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off. And if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head.  
  
###### 7  
A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.  
  
###### 8  
For man did not come from woman, but woman from man.  
  
###### 9  
Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.  
  
###### 10  
For this reason a woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels.  
  
###### 11  
In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.  
  
###### 12  
For just as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.  
  
###### 13  
Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?  
  
###### 14  
Doesn’t nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him,  
  
###### 15  
but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering.  
  
###### 16  
If anyone is inclined to dispute this, we have no other practice, nor do the churches of God.  
  
###### 17  
In the following instructions I have no praise to offer, because your gatherings do more harm than good.  
  
###### 18  
First of all, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.  
  
###### 19  
And indeed, there must be differences among you to show which of you are approved.  
  
###### 20  
Now then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat.  
  
###### 21  
For as you eat, each of you goes ahead without sharing his meal. While one remains hungry, another gets drunk.  
  
###### 22  
Don’t you have your own homes in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What can I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? No, I will not!  
  
###### 23  
For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night He was betrayed, took bread,  
  
###### 24  
and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”  
  
###### 25  
In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”  
  
###### 26  
For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.  
  
###### 27  
Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.  
  
###### 28  
Each one must examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup.  
  
###### 29  
For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.  
  
###### 30  
That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.  
  
###### 31  
Now if we judged ourselves properly, we would not come under judgment.  
  
###### 32  
But when we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world.  
  
###### 33  
So, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.  
  
###### 34  
If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you come together it will not result in judgment. And when I come, I will give instructions about the remaining matters.
