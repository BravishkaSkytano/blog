###### 1  
The elder, To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth—and not I alone, but also all who know the truth—  
  
###### 2  
because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:  
  
###### 3  
Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, will be with us in truth and love.  
  
###### 4  
I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father has commanded us.  
  
###### 5  
And now I urge you, dear lady—not as a new commandment to you, but one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another.  
  
###### 6  
And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the very commandment you have heard from the beginning, that you must walk in love.  
  
###### 7  
For many deceivers have gone out into the world, refusing to confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.  
  
###### 8  
Watch yourselves, so that you do not lose what we have worked for, but that you may be fully rewarded.  
  
###### 9  
Anyone who runs ahead without remaining in the teaching of Christ does not have God. Whoever remains in His teaching has both the Father and the Son.  
  
###### 10  
If anyone comes to you but does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your home or even greet him.  
  
###### 11  
Whoever greets such a person shares in his evil deeds.  
  
###### 12  
I have many things to write to you, but I would prefer not to do so with paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come and speak with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.  
  
###### 13  
The children of your elect sister send you greetings.
