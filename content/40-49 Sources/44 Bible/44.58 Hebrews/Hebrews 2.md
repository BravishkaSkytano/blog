###### 1  
We must pay closer attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.  
  
###### 2  
For if the message spoken by angels was binding, and every transgression and disobedience received its just punishment,  
  
###### 3  
how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? This salvation was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard Him,  
  
###### 4  
and was affirmed by God through signs, wonders, various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to His will.  
  
###### 5  
For it is not to angels that He has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.  
  
###### 6  
But somewhere it is testified in these words: “What is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that You care for him?  
  
###### 7  
You made him a little lower than the angels; You crowned him with glory and honor  
  
###### 8  
and placed everything under his feet.” When God subjected all things to him, He left nothing outside of his control. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to him.  
  
###### 9  
But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because He suffered death, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.  
  
###### 10  
In bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting for God, for whom and through whom all things exist, to make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.  
  
###### 11  
For both the One who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers.  
  
###### 12  
He says: “I will proclaim Your name to My brothers; I will sing Your praises in the assembly.”  
  
###### 13  
And again: “I will put My trust in Him.” And once again: “Here am I, and the children God has given Me.”  
  
###### 14  
Now since the children have flesh and blood, He too shared in their humanity, so that by His death He might destroy him who holds the power of death, that is, the devil,  
  
###### 15  
and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.  
  
###### 16  
For surely it is not the angels He helps, but the descendants of Abraham.  
  
###### 17  
For this reason He had to be made like His brothers in every way, so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, in order to make atonement for the sins of the people.  
  
###### 18  
Because He Himself suffered when He was tempted, He is able to help those who are being tempted.
