###### 1  
Therefore, while the promise of entering His rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be deemed to have fallen short of it.  
  
###### 2  
For we also received the good news just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, since they did not share the faith of those who comprehended it.  
  
###### 3  
Now we who have believed enter that rest. As for the others, it is just as God has said: “So I swore on oath in My anger, ‘They shall never enter My rest.’” And yet His works have been finished since the foundation of the world.  
  
###### 4  
For somewhere He has spoken about the seventh day in this manner: “And on the seventh day God rested from all His works.”  
  
###### 5  
And again, as He says in the passage above: “They shall never enter My rest.”  
  
###### 6  
Since, then, it remains for some to enter His rest, and since those who formerly heard the good news did not enter because of their disobedience,  
  
###### 7  
God again designated a certain day as “Today,” when a long time later He spoke through David as was just stated: “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.”  
  
###### 8  
For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.  
  
###### 9  
There remains, then, a Sabbath rest for the people of God.  
  
###### 10  
For whoever enters God’s rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from His.  
  
###### 11  
Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following the same pattern of disobedience.  
  
###### 12  
For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it pierces even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It judges the thoughts and intentions of the heart.  
  
###### 13  
Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight; everything is uncovered and exposed before the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.  
  
###### 14  
Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we profess.  
  
###### 15  
For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who was tempted in every way that we are, yet was without sin.  
  
###### 16  
Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
