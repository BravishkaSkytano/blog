###### 1  
Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, set your focus on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess.  
  
###### 2  
He was faithful to the One who appointed Him, just as Moses was faithful in all God’s house.  
  
###### 3  
For Jesus has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.  
  
###### 4  
And every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.  
  
###### 5  
Now Moses was faithful as a servant in all God’s house, testifying to what would be spoken later.  
  
###### 6  
But Christ is faithful as the Son over God’s house. And we are His house, if we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope of which we boast.  
  
###### 7  
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: “Today, if you hear His voice,  
  
###### 8  
do not harden your hearts, as you did in the rebellion, in the day of testing in the wilderness,  
  
###### 9  
where your fathers tested and tried Me, and for forty years saw My works.  
  
###### 10  
Therefore I was angry with that generation, and I said, ‘Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known My ways.’  
  
###### 11  
So I swore on oath in My anger, ‘They shall never enter My rest.’”  
  
###### 12  
See to it, brothers, that none of you has a wicked heart of unbelief that turns away from the living God.  
  
###### 13  
But exhort one another daily, as long as it is called today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness.  
  
###### 14  
We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly to the end the assurance we had at first.  
  
###### 15  
As it has been said: “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts, as you did in the rebellion.”  
  
###### 16  
For who were the ones who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?  
  
###### 17  
And with whom was God angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?  
  
###### 18  
And to whom did He swear that they would never enter His rest? Was it not to those who disobeyed?  
  
###### 19  
So we see that it was because of their unbelief that they were unable to enter.
