###### 1  
You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on another. For on whatever grounds you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.  
  
###### 2  
And we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.  
  
###### 3  
So when you, O man, pass judgment on others, yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s judgment?  
  
###### 4  
Or do you disregard the riches of His kindness, tolerance, and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness leads you to repentance?  
  
###### 5  
But because of your hard and unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed.  
  
###### 6  
God “will repay each one according to his deeds.”  
  
###### 7  
To those who by perseverance in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life.  
  
###### 8  
But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow wickedness, there will be wrath and anger.  
  
###### 9  
There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil, first for the Jew, then for the Greek;  
  
###### 10  
but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, first for the Jew, then for the Greek.  
  
###### 11  
For God does not show favoritism.  
  
###### 12  
All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.  
  
###### 13  
For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but it is the doers of the law who will be declared righteous.  
  
###### 14  
Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.  
  
###### 15  
So they show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts either accusing or defending them  
  
###### 16  
on the day when God will judge men’s secrets through Christ Jesus, as proclaimed by my gospel.  
  
###### 17  
Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God;  
  
###### 18  
if you know His will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law;  
  
###### 19  
if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those in darkness,  
  
###### 20  
an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—  
  
###### 21  
you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?  
  
###### 22  
You who forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?  
  
###### 23  
You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?  
  
###### 24  
As it is written: “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”  
  
###### 25  
Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.  
  
###### 26  
If a man who is not circumcised keeps the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?  
  
###### 27  
The one who is physically uncircumcised yet keeps the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.  
  
###### 28  
A man is not a Jew because he is one outwardly, nor is circumcision only outward and physical.  
  
###### 29  
No, a man is a Jew because he is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man’s praise does not come from men, but from God.
