###### 1  
I ask then, did God reject His people? Certainly not! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.  
  
###### 2  
God did not reject His people, whom He foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says about Elijah, how he appealed to God against Israel:  
  
###### 3  
“Lord, they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars. I am the only one left, and they are seeking my life as well”?  
  
###### 4  
And what was the divine reply to him? “I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”  
  
###### 5  
In the same way, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.  
  
###### 6  
And if it is by grace, then it is no longer by works. Otherwise, grace would no longer be grace.  
  
###### 7  
What then? What Israel was seeking, it failed to obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened,  
  
###### 8  
as it is written: “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that could not see, and ears that could not hear, to this very day.”  
  
###### 9  
And David says: “May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution to them.  
  
###### 10  
May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.”  
  
###### 11  
I ask then, did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Certainly not! However, because of their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel jealous.  
  
###### 12  
But if their trespass means riches for the world, and their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!  
  
###### 13  
I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry  
  
###### 14  
in the hope that I may provoke my own people to jealousy and save some of them.  
  
###### 15  
For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?  
  
###### 16  
If the first part of the dough is holy, so is the whole batch; if the root is holy, so are the branches.  
  
###### 17  
Now if some branches have been broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others to share in the nourishment of the olive root,  
  
###### 18  
do not boast over those branches. If you do, remember this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.  
  
###### 19  
You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.”  
  
###### 20  
That is correct: They were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.  
  
###### 21  
For if God did not spare the natural branches, He will certainly not spare you either.  
  
###### 22  
Take notice, therefore, of the kindness and severity of God: severity to those who fell, but kindness to you, if you continue in His kindness. Otherwise you also will be cut off.  
  
###### 23  
And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.  
  
###### 24  
For if you were cut from a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into one that is cultivated, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!  
  
###### 25  
I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you will not be conceited: A hardening in part has come to Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.  
  
###### 26  
And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: “The Deliverer will come from Zion; He will remove godlessness from Jacob.  
  
###### 27  
And this is My covenant with them when I take away their sins.”  
  
###### 28  
Regarding the gospel, they are enemies on your account; but regarding election, they are loved on account of the patriarchs.  
  
###### 29  
For God’s gifts and His call are irrevocable.  
  
###### 30  
Just as you who formerly disobeyed God have now received mercy through their disobedience,  
  
###### 31  
so they too have now disobeyed, in order that they too may now receive mercy through the mercy shown to you.  
  
###### 32  
For God has consigned everyone to disobedience so that He may have mercy on everyone.  
  
###### 33  
O, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and untraceable His ways!  
  
###### 34  
“Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counselor?”  
  
###### 35  
“Who has first given to God, that God should repay him?”  
  
###### 36  
For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever! Amen.
