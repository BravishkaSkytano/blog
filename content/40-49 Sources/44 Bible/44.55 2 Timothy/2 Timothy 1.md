###### 13  
Hold on to the pattern of sound teaching you have heard from me, with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.  
  
###### 14  
Guard the treasure entrusted to you, with the help of the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.  
  
###### 15  
You know that everyone in the Province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.  
  
###### 16  
May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he has often refreshed me and was unashamed of my chains.  
  
###### 17  
Indeed, when he arrived in Rome, he searched diligently until he found me.  
  
###### 18  
May the Lord grant Onesiphorus His mercy on that day. You know very well how much he ministered to me in Ephesus.
