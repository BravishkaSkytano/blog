###### 1  
But understand this: In the last days terrible times will come.  
  
###### 2  
For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,  
  
###### 3  
unloving, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, without love of good,  
  
###### 4  
traitorous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,  
  
###### 5  
having a form of godliness but denying its power. Turn away from such as these!  
  
###### 6  
They are the kind who worm their way into households and captivate vulnerable women who are weighed down with sins and led astray by various passions,  
  
###### 7  
who are always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth.  
  
###### 8  
Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth. They are depraved in mind and disqualified from the faith.  
  
###### 9  
But they will not advance much further. For just like Jannes and Jambres, their folly will be plain to everyone.  
  
###### 10

###### 11  
my persecutions, and the sufferings that came upon me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. What persecutions I endured! Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.  
  
###### 12  
Indeed, all who desire to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,  
  
###### 13  
while evil men and imposters go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.  
  
###### 14  
But as for you, continue in the things you have learned and firmly believed, since you know from whom you have learned them.  
  
###### 15  
From infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.  
  
###### 16  
All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for instruction, for conviction, for correction, and for training in righteousness,  
  
###### 17  
so that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.
