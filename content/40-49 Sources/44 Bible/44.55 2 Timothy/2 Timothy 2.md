###### 1  
You therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.  
  
###### 2  
And the things that you have heard me say among many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be qualified to teach others as well.  
  
###### 3  
Join me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.  
  
###### 4  
A soldier refrains from entangling himself in civilian affairs, in order to please the one who enlisted him.  
  
###### 5  
Likewise, a competitor does not receive the crown unless he competes according to the rules.  
  
###### 6  
The hardworking farmer should be the first to partake of the crops.  
  
###### 7  
Consider what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all things.  
  
###### 8  
Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David, as proclaimed by my gospel,  
  
###### 9  
for which I suffer to the extent of being chained like a criminal. But the word of God cannot be chained!  
  
###### 10  
For this reason I endure all things for the sake of the elect, so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.  
  
###### 11  
This is a trustworthy saying: If we died with Him, we will also live with Him;  
  
###### 12  
if we endure, we will also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He will also deny us;  
  
###### 13  
if we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.  
  
###### 14  
Remind the believers of these things, charging them before God to avoid quarreling over words, which succeeds only in leading the listeners to ruin.  
  
###### 15  
Make every effort to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman who accurately handles the word of truth.  
  
###### 16  
But avoid irreverent, empty chatter, which will only lead to more ungodliness,  
  
###### 17  
and the talk of such men will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,  
  
###### 18  
who have deviated from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already occurred, and they undermine the faith of some.  
  
###### 19  
Nevertheless, God’s firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: “The Lord knows those who are His,” and, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord must turn away from iniquity.”  
  
###### 20  
A large house contains not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay. Some indeed are for honorable use, but others are for common use.  
  
###### 21  
So if anyone cleanses himself of what is unfit, he will be a vessel for honor: sanctified, useful to the Master, and prepared for every good work.  
  
###### 22  
Flee from youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, together with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.  
  
###### 23  
But reject foolish and ignorant speculation, for you know that it breeds quarreling.  
  
###### 24  
And a servant of the Lord must not be quarrelsome, but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, and forbearing.  
  
###### 25  
He must gently reprove those who oppose him, in the hope that God may grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth.  
  
###### 26  
Then they will come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, who has taken them captive to his will.
