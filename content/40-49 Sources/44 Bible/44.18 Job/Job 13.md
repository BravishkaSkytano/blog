###### 1  
“Indeed, my eyes have seen all this; my ears have heard and understood.  
  
###### 2  
What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.  
  
###### 3  
Yet I desire to speak to the Almighty and argue my case before God.  
  
###### 4  
You, however, smear with lies; you are all worthless physicians.  
  
###### 5  
If only you would remain silent; for that would be your wisdom!  
  
###### 6  
Hear now my argument, and listen to the plea of my lips.  
  
###### 7  
Will you speak wickedly on God’s behalf or speak deceitfully for Him?  
  
###### 8  
Would you show Him partiality or argue in His defense?  
  
###### 9  
Would it be well when He examined you? Could you deceive Him like a man?  
  
###### 10  
Surely He would rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality.  
  
###### 11  
Would His majesty not terrify you? Would the dread of Him not fall upon you?  
  
###### 12  
Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay.  
  
###### 13  
Be silent, and I will speak. Then let come to me what may.  
  
###### 14  
Why do I put myself at risk and take my life in my own hands?  
  
###### 15  
Though He slay me, I will hope in Him. I will still defend my ways to His face.  
  
###### 16  
Moreover, this will be my salvation, for no godless man can appear before Him.  
  
###### 17  
Listen carefully to my words; let my declaration ring in your ears.  
  
###### 18  
Behold, now that I have prepared my case, I know that I will be vindicated.  
  
###### 19  
Can anyone indict me? If so, I will be silent and die.  
  
###### 20  
Only grant these two things to me, so that I need not hide from You:  
  
###### 21  
Withdraw Your hand from me, and do not let Your terror frighten me.  
  
###### 22  
Then call me, and I will answer, or let me speak, and You can reply.  
  
###### 23  
How many are my iniquities and sins? Reveal to me my transgression and sin.  
  
###### 24  
Why do You hide Your face and consider me as Your enemy?  
  
###### 25  
Would You frighten a windblown leaf? Would You chase after dry chaff?  
  
###### 26  
For You record bitter accusations against me and bequeath to me the iniquities of my youth.  
  
###### 27  
You put my feet in the stocks and stand watch over all my paths; You set a limit for the soles of my feet.  
  
###### 28  
So man wastes away like something rotten, like a moth-eaten garment.
