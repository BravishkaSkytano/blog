###### 1  
“At this my heart also pounds and leaps from its place.  
  
###### 2  
Listen closely to the thunder of His voice and the rumbling that comes from His mouth.  
  
###### 3  
He unleashes His lightning beneath the whole sky and sends it to the ends of the earth.  
  
###### 4  
Then there comes a roaring sound; He thunders with His majestic voice. He does not restrain the lightning when His voice resounds.  
  
###### 5  
God thunders wondrously with His voice; He does great things we cannot comprehend.  
  
###### 6  
For He says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’ and to the gentle rain, ‘Pour out a mighty downpour.’  
  
###### 7  
He seals up the hand of every man, so that all men may know His work.  
  
###### 8  
The wild animals enter their lairs; they settle down in their dens.  
  
###### 9  
The tempest comes from its chamber, and the cold from the driving north winds.  
  
###### 10  
By the breath of God the ice is formed and the watery expanses are frozen.  
  
###### 11  
He loads the clouds with moisture; He scatters His lightning through them.  
  
###### 12  
They swirl about, whirling at His direction, accomplishing all that He commands over the face of all the earth.  
  
###### 13  
Whether for punishment or for His land, He accomplishes this in His loving devotion.  
  
###### 14  
Listen to this, O Job; stand still and consider the wonders of God.  
  
###### 15  
Do you know how God dispatches the clouds or makes the lightning flash?  
  
###### 16  
Do you understand how the clouds float, those wonders of Him who is perfect in knowledge?  
  
###### 17  
You whose clothes get hot when the land lies hushed under the south wind,  
  
###### 18  
can you, like Him, spread out the skies to reflect the heat like a mirror of bronze?  
  
###### 19  
Teach us what we should say to Him; we cannot draw up our case when our faces are in darkness.  
  
###### 20  
Should He be told that I want to speak? Would a man ask to be swallowed up?  
  
###### 21  
Now no one can gaze at the sun when it is bright in the skies after the wind has swept them clean.  
  
###### 22  
Out of the north He comes in golden splendor; awesome majesty surrounds Him.  
  
###### 23  
The Almighty is beyond our reach; He is exalted in power! In His justice and great righteousness He does not oppress.  
  
###### 24  
Therefore, men fear Him, for He is not partial to the wise in heart.”
