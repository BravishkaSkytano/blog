###### 1  
“Can you pull in Leviathan with a hook or tie down his tongue with a rope?  
  
###### 2  
Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?  
  
###### 3  
Will he beg you for mercy or speak to you softly?  
  
###### 4  
Will he make a covenant with you to take him as a slave for life?  
  
###### 5  
Can you pet him like a bird or put him on a leash for your maidens?  
  
###### 6  
Will traders barter for him or divide him among the merchants?  
  
###### 7  
Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?  
  
###### 8  
If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the battle and never repeat it!  
  
###### 9  
Surely hope of overcoming him is false. Is not the sight of him overwhelming?  
  
###### 10  
No one is so fierce as to rouse Leviathan. Then who is able to stand against Me?  
  
###### 11  
Who has given to Me that I should repay him? Everything under heaven is Mine.  
  
###### 12  
I cannot keep silent about his limbs, his power and graceful form.  
  
###### 13  
Who can strip off his outer coat? Who can approach him with a bridle?  
  
###### 14  
Who can open his jaws, ringed by his fearsome teeth?  
  
###### 15  
His rows of scales are his pride, tightly sealed together.  
  
###### 16  
One scale is so near to another that no air can pass between them.  
  
###### 17  
They are joined to one another; they clasp and cannot be separated.  
  
###### 18  
His snorting flashes with light, and his eyes are like the rays of dawn.  
  
###### 19  
Firebrands stream from his mouth; fiery sparks shoot forth!  
  
###### 20  
Smoke billows from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over burning reeds.  
  
###### 21  
His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames pour from his mouth.  
  
###### 22  
Strength resides in his neck, and dismay leaps before him.  
  
###### 23  
The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.  
  
###### 24  
His chest is as hard as a rock, as hard as a lower millstone!  
  
###### 25  
When Leviathan rises up, the mighty are terrified; they withdraw before his thrashing.  
  
###### 26  
The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or dart or arrow.  
  
###### 27  
He regards iron as straw and bronze as rotten wood.  
  
###### 28  
No arrow can make him flee; slingstones become like chaff to him.  
  
###### 29  
A club is regarded as straw, and he laughs at the sound of the lance.  
  
###### 30  
His undersides are jagged potsherds, spreading out the mud like a threshing sledge.  
  
###### 31  
He makes the depths seethe like a cauldron; he makes the sea like a jar of ointment.  
  
###### 32  
He leaves a glistening wake behind him; one would think the deep had white hair!  
  
###### 33  
Nothing on earth is his equal—a creature devoid of fear!  
  
###### 34  
He looks down on all the haughty; he is king over all the proud.”
