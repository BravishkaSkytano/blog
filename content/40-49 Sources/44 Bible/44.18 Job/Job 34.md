###### 1  
Then Elihu continued:  
  
###### 2  
“Hear my words, O wise men; give ear to me, O men of learning.  
  
###### 3  
For the ear tests words as the mouth tastes food.  
  
###### 4  
Let us choose for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.  
  
###### 5  
For Job has declared, ‘I am righteous, yet God has deprived me of justice.  
  
###### 6  
Would I lie about my case? My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.’  
  
###### 7  
What man is like Job, who drinks up derision like water?  
  
###### 8  
He keeps company with evildoers and walks with wicked men.  
  
###### 9  
For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing that he should delight in God.’  
  
###### 10  
Therefore listen to me, O men of understanding. Far be it from God to do wrong, and from the Almighty to act unjustly.  
  
###### 11  
For according to a man’s deeds He repays him; according to a man’s ways He brings consequences.  
  
###### 12  
Indeed, it is true that God does not act wickedly, and the Almighty does not pervert justice.  
  
###### 13  
Who gave Him charge over the earth? Who appointed Him over the whole world?  
  
###### 14  
If He were to set His heart to it and withdraw His Spirit and breath,  
  
###### 15  
all flesh would perish together and mankind would return to the dust.  
  
###### 16  
If you have understanding, hear this; listen to my words.  
  
###### 17  
Could one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One,  
  
###### 18  
who says to kings, ‘You are worthless!’ and to nobles, ‘You are wicked,’  
  
###### 19  
who is not partial to princes and does not favor rich over poor? For they are all the work of His hands.  
  
###### 20  
They die in an instant, in the middle of the night. The people convulse and pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand.  
  
###### 21  
For His eyes are on the ways of a man, and He sees his every step.  
  
###### 22  
There is no darkness or deep shadow where the workers of iniquity can hide.  
  
###### 23  
For God need not examine a man further or have him approach for judgment.  
  
###### 24  
He shatters the mighty without inquiry and sets up others in their place.  
  
###### 25  
Therefore, He recognizes their deeds; He overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.  
  
###### 26  
He strikes them for their wickedness in full view,  
  
###### 27  
because they turned aside from Him and had no regard for any of His ways.  
  
###### 28  
They caused the cry of the poor to come before Him, and He heard the outcry of the afflicted.  
  
###### 29  
But when He remains silent, who can condemn Him? When He hides His face, who can see Him? Yet He watches over both man and nation,  
  
###### 30  
that godless men should not rule or lay snares for the people.  
  
###### 31  
Suppose someone says to God, ‘I have endured my punishment; I will offend no more.  
  
###### 32  
Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do it again.’  
  
###### 33  
Should God repay you on your own terms when you have disavowed His? You must choose, not I; so tell me what you know.  
  
###### 34  
Men of understanding will declare to me, and the wise men who hear me will say:  
  
###### 35  
‘Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.’  
  
###### 36  
If only Job were tried to the utmost for answering like a wicked man.  
  
###### 37  
For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God.”
