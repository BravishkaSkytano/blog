###### 1  
Then Job answered:  
  
###### 2  
“I have heard many things like these; miserable comforters are you all.  
  
###### 3  
Is there no end to your long-winded speeches? What provokes you to continue testifying?  
  
###### 4  
I could also speak like you if you were in my place; I could heap up words against you and shake my head at you.  
  
###### 5  
But I would encourage you with my mouth, and the consolation of my lips would bring relief.  
  
###### 6  
Even if I speak, my pain is not relieved, and if I hold back, how will it go away?  
  
###### 7  
Surely He has now exhausted me; You have devastated all my family.  
  
###### 8  
You have bound me, and it has become a witness; my frailty rises up and testifies against me.  
  
###### 9  
His anger has torn me and opposed me; He gnashes His teeth at me. My adversary pierces me with His eyes.  
  
###### 10  
They open their mouths against me and strike my cheeks with contempt; they join together against me.  
  
###### 11  
God has delivered me to unjust men; He has thrown me to the clutches of the wicked.  
  
###### 12  
I was at ease, but He shattered me; He seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has set me up as His target;  
  
###### 13  
His archers surround me. He pierces my kidneys without mercy and spills my gall on the ground.  
  
###### 14  
He breaks me with wound upon wound; He rushes me like a mighty warrior.  
  
###### 15  
I have sewn sackcloth over my skin; I have buried my horn in the dust.  
  
###### 16  
My face is red with weeping, and deep shadows ring my eyes;  
  
###### 17  
yet my hands are free of violence and my prayer is pure.  
  
###### 18  
O earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry for help never be laid to rest.  
  
###### 19  
Even now my witness is in heaven, and my advocate is on high.  
  
###### 20  
My friends are my scoffers as my eyes pour out tears to God.  
  
###### 21  
Oh, that a man might plead with God as he pleads with his neighbor!  
  
###### 22  
For when only a few years are past I will go the way of no return.
