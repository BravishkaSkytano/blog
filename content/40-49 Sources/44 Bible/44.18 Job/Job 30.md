###### 1  
“But now they mock me, men younger than I am, whose fathers I would have refused to entrust with my sheep dogs.  
  
###### 2  
What use to me was the strength of their hands, since their vigor had left them?  
  
###### 3  
Gaunt from poverty and hunger, they gnawed the dry land, and the desolate wasteland by night.  
  
###### 4  
They plucked mallow among the shrubs, and the roots of the broom tree were their food.  
  
###### 5  
They were banished from among men, shouted down like thieves,  
  
###### 6  
so that they lived on the slopes of the wadis, among the rocks and in holes in the ground.  
  
###### 7  
They cried out among the shrubs and huddled beneath the nettles.  
  
###### 8  
A senseless and nameless brood, they were driven off the land.  
  
###### 9  
And now they mock me in song; I have become a byword among them.  
  
###### 10  
They abhor me and keep far from me; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.  
  
###### 11  
Because God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they have cast off restraint in my presence.  
  
###### 12  
The rabble arises at my right; they lay snares for my feet and build siege ramps against me.  
  
###### 13  
They tear up my path; they profit from my destruction, with no one to restrain them.  
  
###### 14  
They advance as through a wide breach; through the ruins they keep rolling in.  
  
###### 15  
Terrors are turned loose against me; they drive away my dignity as by the wind, and my prosperity has passed like a cloud.  
  
###### 16  
And now my soul is poured out within me; days of affliction grip me.  
  
###### 17  
Night pierces my bones, and my gnawing pains never rest.  
  
###### 18  
With great force He grasps my garment; He seizes me by the collar of my tunic.  
  
###### 19  
He throws me into the mud, and I have become like dust and ashes.  
  
###### 20  
I cry out to You for help, but You do not answer; when I stand up, You merely look at me.  
  
###### 21  
You have ruthlessly turned on me; You oppose me with Your strong hand.  
  
###### 22  
You snatch me up into the wind and drive me before it; You toss me about in the storm.  
  
###### 23  
Yes, I know that You will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living.  
  
###### 24  
Yet no one stretches out his hand to a ruined man when he cries for help in his distress.  
  
###### 25  
Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has my soul not grieved for the needy?  
  
###### 26  
But when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, darkness fell.  
  
###### 27  
I am churning within and cannot rest; days of affliction confront me.  
  
###### 28  
I go about blackened, but not by the sun. I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.  
  
###### 29  
I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of ostriches.  
  
###### 30  
My skin grows black and peels, and my bones burn with fever.  
  
###### 31  
My harp is tuned to mourning and my flute to the sound of weeping.
