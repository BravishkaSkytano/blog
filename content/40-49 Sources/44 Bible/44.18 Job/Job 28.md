###### 1  
“Surely there is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.  
  
###### 2  
Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore.  
  
###### 3  
Man puts an end to the darkness; he probes the farthest recesses for ore in deepest darkness.  
  
###### 4  
Far from human habitation he cuts a shaft in places forgotten by the foot of man. Far from men he dangles and sways.  
  
###### 5  
Food may come from the earth, but from below it is transformed as by fire.  
  
###### 6  
Its rocks are the source of sapphires, containing flecks of gold.  
  
###### 7  
No bird of prey knows that path; no falcon’s eye has seen it.  
  
###### 8  
Proud beasts have never trodden it; no lion has ever prowled over it.  
  
###### 9  
The miner strikes the flint; he overturns mountains at their base.  
  
###### 10  
He hews out channels in the rocks, and his eyes spot every treasure.  
  
###### 11  
He stops up the sources of the streams to bring what is hidden to light.  
  
###### 12  
But where can wisdom be found, and where does understanding dwell?  
  
###### 13  
No man can know its value, nor is it found in the land of the living.  
  
###### 14  
The ocean depths say, ‘It is not in me,’ while the sea declares, ‘It is not with me.’  
  
###### 15  
It cannot be bought with gold, nor can its price be weighed out in silver.  
  
###### 16  
It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire.  
  
###### 17  
Neither gold nor crystal can compare to it, nor jewels of fine gold be exchanged for it.  
  
###### 18  
Coral and quartz are unworthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.  
  
###### 19  
Topaz from Cush cannot compare to it, nor can it be valued in pure gold.  
  
###### 20  
From where then does wisdom come, and where does understanding dwell?  
  
###### 21  
It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing and concealed from the birds of the air.  
  
###### 22  
Abaddon and Death say, ‘We have heard a rumor about it.’  
  
###### 23  
But God understands its way, and He knows its place.  
  
###### 24  
For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.  
  
###### 25  
When God fixed the weight of the wind and measured out the waters,  
  
###### 26  
when He set a limit for the rain and a path for the thunderbolt,  
  
###### 27  
then He looked at wisdom and appraised it; He established it and searched it out.  
  
###### 28  
And He said to man, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.’”
