###### 1  
Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:  
  
###### 2  
“Does a wise man answer with empty counsel or fill his belly with the hot east wind?  
  
###### 3  
Should he argue with useless words or speeches that serve no purpose?  
  
###### 4  
But you even undermine the fear of God and hinder meditation before Him.  
  
###### 5  
For your iniquity instructs your mouth, and you choose the language of the crafty.  
  
###### 6  
Your own mouth, not mine, condemns you; your own lips testify against you.  
  
###### 7  
Were you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?  
  
###### 8  
Do you listen in on the council of God or limit wisdom to yourself?  
  
###### 9  
What do you know that we do not? What do you understand that is not clear to us?  
  
###### 10  
Both the gray-haired and the aged are on our side—men much older than your father.  
  
###### 11  
Are the consolations of God not enough for you, even words spoken gently to you?  
  
###### 12  
Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash,  
  
###### 13  
as you turn your spirit against God and pour such words from your mouth?  
  
###### 14  
What is man, that he should be pure, or one born of woman, that he should be righteous?  
  
###### 15  
If God puts no trust in His holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in His eyes,  
  
###### 16  
how much less man, who is vile and corrupt, who drinks injustice like water?  
  
###### 17  
Listen to me and I will inform you. I will describe what I have seen,  
  
###### 18  
what was declared by wise men and was not concealed from their fathers,  
  
###### 19  
to whom alone the land was given when no foreigner passed among them.  
  
###### 20  
A wicked man writhes in pain all his days; only a few years are reserved for the ruthless.  
  
###### 21  
Sounds of terror fill his ears; in his prosperity the destroyer attacks him.  
  
###### 22  
He despairs of his return from darkness; he is marked for the sword.  
  
###### 23  
He wanders about as food for vultures; he knows the day of darkness is at hand.  
  
###### 24  
Distress and anguish terrify him, overwhelming him like a king poised to attack.  
  
###### 25  
For he has stretched out his hand against God and has vaunted himself against the Almighty,  
  
###### 26  
rushing headlong at Him with a thick, studded shield.  
  
###### 27  
Though his face is covered with fat and his waistline bulges with flesh,  
  
###### 28  
he will dwell in ruined cities, in abandoned houses destined to become rubble.  
  
###### 29  
He will no longer be rich; his wealth will not endure. His possessions will not overspread the land.  
  
###### 30  
He will not escape from the darkness; the flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God’s mouth will carry him away.  
  
###### 31  
Let him not deceive himself with trust in emptiness, for emptiness will be his reward.  
  
###### 32  
It will be paid in full before his time, and his branch will not flourish.  
  
###### 33  
He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree that sheds its blossoms.  
  
###### 34  
For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of bribery.  
  
###### 35  
They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb is pregnant with deceit.”
