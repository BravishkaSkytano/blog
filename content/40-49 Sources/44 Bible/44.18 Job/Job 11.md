###### 1  
Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:  
  
###### 2  
“Should this stream of words go unanswered and such a speaker be vindicated?  
  
###### 3  
Should your babbling put others to silence? Will you scoff without rebuke?  
  
###### 4  
You have said, ‘My doctrine is sound, and I am pure in Your sight.’  
  
###### 5  
But if only God would speak and open His lips against you,  
  
###### 6  
and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know then that God exacts from you less than your iniquity deserves.  
  
###### 7  
Can you fathom the deep things of God or discover the limits of the Almighty?  
  
###### 8  
They are higher than the heavens—what can you do? They are deeper than Sheol—what can you know?  
  
###### 9  
Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.  
  
###### 10  
If He comes along to imprison you, or convenes a court, who can stop Him?  
  
###### 11  
Surely He knows the deceit of men. If He sees iniquity, does He not take note?  
  
###### 12  
But a witless man can no more become wise than the colt of a wild donkey can be born a man!  
  
###### 13  
As for you, if you direct your heart and lift up your hands to Him,  
  
###### 14  
if you put away the iniquity in your hand, and allow no injustice to dwell in your tents,  
  
###### 15  
then indeed you will lift up your face without shame; you will stand firm and unafraid.  
  
###### 16  
For you will forget your misery, recalling it only as waters gone by.  
  
###### 17  
Your life will be brighter than noonday; its darkness will be like the morning.  
  
###### 18  
You will be secure, because there is hope, and you will look around and lie down in safety.  
  
###### 19  
You will lie down without fear, and many will court your favor.  
  
###### 20  
But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape will elude them; they will hope for their last breath.”
