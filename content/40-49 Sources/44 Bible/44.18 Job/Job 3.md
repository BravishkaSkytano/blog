###### 1  
After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.  
  
###### 2  
And this is what he said:  
  
###### 3  
“May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, ‘A boy is conceived.’  
  
###### 4  
If only that day had turned to darkness! May God above disregard it; may no light shine upon it.  
  
###### 5  
May darkness and gloom reclaim it, and a cloud settle over it; may the blackness of the day overwhelm it.  
  
###### 6  
If only darkness had taken that night away! May it not appear among the days of the year; may it never be entered in any of the months.  
  
###### 7  
Behold, may that night be barren; may no joyful voice come into it.  
  
###### 8  
May it be cursed by those who curse the day—those prepared to rouse Leviathan.  
  
###### 9  
May its morning stars grow dark; may it wait in vain for daylight; may it not see the breaking of dawn.  
  
###### 10  
For that night did not shut the doors of the womb to hide the sorrow from my eyes.  
  
###### 11  
Why did I not perish at birth; why did I not die as I came from the womb?  
  
###### 12  
Why were there knees to receive me, and breasts that I should be nursed?  
  
###### 13  
For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest  
  
###### 14  
with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves cities now in ruins,  
  
###### 15  
or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.  
  
###### 16  
Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child, like an infant who never sees daylight?  
  
###### 17  
There the wicked cease from raging, and there the weary find rest.  
  
###### 18  
The captives enjoy their ease; they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.  
  
###### 19  
Both small and great are there, and the slave is freed from his master.  
  
###### 20  
Why is light given to the miserable, and life to the bitter of soul,  
  
###### 21  
who long for death that does not come, and search for it like hidden treasure,  
  
###### 22  
who rejoice and greatly exult when they can find the grave?  
  
###### 23  
Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?  
  
###### 24  
I sigh when food is put before me, and my groans pour out like water.  
  
###### 25  
For the thing I feared has overtaken me, and what I dreaded has befallen me.  
  
###### 26  
I am not at ease or quiet; I have no rest, for trouble has come.”
