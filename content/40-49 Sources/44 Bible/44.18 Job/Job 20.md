###### 1  
Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:  
  
###### 2  
“So my anxious thoughts compel me to answer, because of the turmoil within me.  
  
###### 3  
I have heard a rebuke that insults me, and my understanding prompts a reply.  
  
###### 4  
Do you not know that from antiquity, since man was placed on the earth,  
  
###### 5  
the triumph of the wicked has been brief and the joy of the godless momentary?  
  
###### 6  
Though his arrogance reaches the heavens, and his head touches the clouds,  
  
###### 7  
he will perish forever, like his own dung; those who had seen him will ask, ‘Where is he?’  
  
###### 8  
He will fly away like a dream, never to be found; he will be chased away like a vision in the night.  
  
###### 9  
The eye that saw him will see him no more, and his place will no longer behold him.  
  
###### 10  
His sons will seek the favor of the poor, for his own hands must return his wealth.  
  
###### 11  
The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie down with him in the dust.  
  
###### 12  
Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he conceals it under his tongue,  
  
###### 13  
though he cannot bear to let it go and keeps it in his mouth,  
  
###### 14  
yet in his stomach his food sours into the venom of cobras within him.  
  
###### 15  
He swallows wealth but vomits it out; God will force it from his stomach.  
  
###### 16  
He will suck the poison of cobras; the fangs of a viper will kill him.  
  
###### 17  
He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.  
  
###### 18  
He must return the fruit of his labor without consuming it; he cannot enjoy the profits of his trading.  
  
###### 19  
For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor; he has seized houses he did not build.  
  
###### 20  
Because his appetite is never satisfied, he cannot escape with his treasure.  
  
###### 21  
Nothing is left for him to consume; thus his prosperity will not endure.  
  
###### 22  
In the midst of his plenty, he will be distressed; the full force of misery will come upon him.  
  
###### 23  
When he has filled his stomach, God will vent His fury upon him, raining it down on him as he eats.  
  
###### 24  
Though he flees from an iron weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow will pierce him.  
  
###### 25  
It is drawn out of his back, the gleaming point from his liver. Terrors come over him.  
  
###### 26  
Total darkness is reserved for his treasures. A fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent.  
  
###### 27  
The heavens will expose his iniquity, and the earth will rise up against him.  
  
###### 28  
The possessions of his house will be removed, flowing away on the day of God’s wrath.  
  
###### 29  
This is the wicked man’s portion from God, the inheritance God has appointed him.”
