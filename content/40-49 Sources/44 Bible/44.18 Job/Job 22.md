###### 1  
Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:  
  
###### 2  
“Can a man be of use to God? Can even a wise man benefit Him?  
  
###### 3  
Does it delight the Almighty that you are righteous? Does He profit if your ways are blameless?  
  
###### 4  
Is it for your reverence that He rebukes you and enters into judgment against you?  
  
###### 5  
Is not your wickedness great? Are not your iniquities endless?  
  
###### 6  
For you needlessly demanded security from your brothers and deprived the naked of their clothing.  
  
###### 7  
You gave no water to the weary and withheld food from the famished,  
  
###### 8  
while the land belonged to a mighty man, and a man of honor lived on it.  
  
###### 9  
You sent widows away empty-handed, and the strength of the fatherless was crushed.  
  
###### 10  
Therefore snares surround you, and sudden peril terrifies you;  
  
###### 11  
it is so dark you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you.  
  
###### 12  
Is not God as high as the heavens? Look at the highest stars, how lofty they are!  
  
###### 13  
Yet you say: ‘What does God know? Does He judge through thick darkness?  
  
###### 14  
Thick clouds veil Him so He does not see us as He traverses the vault of heaven.’  
  
###### 15  
Will you stay on the ancient path that wicked men have trod?  
  
###### 16  
They were snatched away before their time, and their foundations were swept away by a flood.  
  
###### 17  
They said to God, ‘Depart from us. What can the Almighty do to us?’  
  
###### 18  
But it was He who filled their houses with good things; so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked.  
  
###### 19  
The righteous see it and are glad; the innocent mock them:  
  
###### 20  
‘Surely our foes are destroyed, and fire has consumed their excess.’  
  
###### 21  
Reconcile now and be at peace with Him; thereby good will come to you.  
  
###### 22  
Receive instruction from His mouth, and lay up His words in your heart.  
  
###### 23  
If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored. If you remove injustice from your tents  
  
###### 24  
and consign your gold to the dust and the gold of Ophir to the stones of the ravines,  
  
###### 25  
then the Almighty will be your gold and the finest silver for you.  
  
###### 26  
Surely then you will delight in the Almighty and lift up your face to God.  
  
###### 27  
You will pray to Him, and He will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows.  
  
###### 28  
Your decisions will be carried out, and light will shine on your ways.  
  
###### 29  
When men are brought low and you say, ‘Lift them up!’ then He will save the lowly.  
  
###### 30  
He will deliver even one who is not innocent, rescuing him through the cleanness of your hands.”
