###### 1  
Then Job answered:  
  
###### 2  
“Truly then you are the people with whom wisdom itself will die!  
  
###### 3  
But I also have a mind; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these?  
  
###### 4  
I am a laughingstock to my friends, though I called on God, and He answered. The righteous and upright man is a laughingstock.  
  
###### 5  
The one at ease scorns misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.  
  
###### 6  
The tents of robbers are safe, and those who provoke God are secure—those who carry their god in their hands.  
  
###### 7  
But ask the animals, and they will instruct you; ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you.  
  
###### 8  
Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; let the fish of the sea inform you.  
  
###### 9  
Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?  
  
###### 10  
The life of every living thing is in His hand, as well as the breath of all mankind.  
  
###### 11  
Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes its food?  
  
###### 12  
Wisdom is found with the elderly, and understanding comes with long life.  
  
###### 13  
Wisdom and strength belong to God; counsel and understanding are His.  
  
###### 14  
What He tears down cannot be rebuilt; the man He imprisons cannot be released.  
  
###### 15  
If He holds back the waters, they dry up, and if He releases them, they overwhelm the land.  
  
###### 16  
True wisdom and power belong to Him. The deceived and the deceiver are His.  
  
###### 17  
He leads counselors away barefoot and makes fools of judges.  
  
###### 18  
He loosens the bonds placed by kings and fastens a belt around their waists.  
  
###### 19  
He leads priests away barefoot and overthrows the established.  
  
###### 20  
He deprives the trusted of speech and takes away the discernment of elders.  
  
###### 21  
He pours out contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty.  
  
###### 22  
He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into light.  
  
###### 23  
He makes nations great and destroys them; He enlarges nations, then disperses them.  
  
###### 24  
He deprives the earth’s leaders of reason and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland.  
  
###### 25  
They grope in the darkness without light; He makes them stagger like drunkards.
