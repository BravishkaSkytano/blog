###### 1  
Then Job answered:  
  
###### 2  
“Yes, I know that it is so, but how can a mortal be righteous before God?  
  
###### 3  
If one wished to contend with God, he could not answer Him one time out of a thousand.  
  
###### 4  
God is wise in heart and mighty in strength. Who has resisted Him and prospered?  
  
###### 5  
He moves mountains without their knowledge and overturns them in His anger.  
  
###### 6  
He shakes the earth from its place, so that its foundations tremble.  
  
###### 7  
He commands the sun not to shine; He seals off the stars.  
  
###### 8  
He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.  
  
###### 9  
He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, of the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.  
  
###### 10  
He does great things beyond searching out, and wonders without number.  
  
###### 11  
Were He to pass by me, I would not see Him; were He to move, I would not recognize Him.  
  
###### 12  
If He takes away, who can stop Him? Who dares to ask Him, ‘What are You doing?’  
  
###### 13  
God does not restrain His anger; the helpers of Rahab cower beneath Him.  
  
###### 14  
How then can I answer Him or choose my arguments against Him?  
  
###### 15  
For even if I were right, I could not answer. I could only beg my Judge for mercy.  
  
###### 16  
If I summoned Him and He answered me, I do not believe He would listen to my voice.  
  
###### 17  
For He would crush me with a tempest and multiply my wounds without cause.  
  
###### 18  
He does not let me catch my breath, but overwhelms me with bitterness.  
  
###### 19  
If it is a matter of strength, He is indeed mighty! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon Him?  
  
###### 20  
Even if I were righteous, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would declare me guilty.  
  
###### 21  
Though I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.  
  
###### 22  
It is all the same, and so I say, ‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’  
  
###### 23  
When the scourge brings sudden death, He mocks the despair of the innocent.  
  
###### 24  
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He blindfolds its judges. If it is not He, then who is it?  
  
###### 25  
My days are swifter than a runner; they flee without seeing good.  
  
###### 26  
They sweep by like boats of papyrus, like an eagle swooping down on its prey.  
  
###### 27  
If I were to say, ‘I will forget my complaint and change my expression and smile,’  
  
###### 28  
I would still dread all my sufferings; I know that You will not acquit me.  
  
###### 29  
Since I am already found guilty, why should I labor in vain?  
  
###### 30  
If I should wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye,  
  
###### 31  
then You would plunge me into the pit, and even my own clothes would despise me.  
  
###### 32  
For He is not a man like me, that I can answer Him, that we can take each other to court.  
  
###### 33  
Nor is there a mediator between us, to lay his hand upon us both.  
  
###### 34  
Let Him remove His rod from me, so that His terror will no longer frighten me.  
  
###### 35  
Then I would speak without fear of Him. But as it is, I am on my own.
