###### 1  
Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:  
  
###### 2  
“How long will you go on saying such things? The words of your mouth are a blustering wind.  
  
###### 3  
Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?  
  
###### 4  
When your children sinned against Him, He gave them over to their rebellion.  
  
###### 5  
But if you would earnestly seek God and ask the Almighty for mercy,  
  
###### 6  
if you are pure and upright, even now He will rouse Himself on your behalf and restore your righteous estate.  
  
###### 7  
Though your beginnings were modest, your latter days will flourish.  
  
###### 8  
Please inquire of past generations and consider the discoveries of their fathers.  
  
###### 9  
For we were born yesterday and know nothing; our days on earth are but a shadow.  
  
###### 10  
Will they not teach you and tell you, and speak from their understanding?

###### 12

His confidence is fragile; his security is in a spider’s web.

###### 16  
He is a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden.  
  
###### 17  
His roots wrap around the rock heap; he looks for a home among the stones.  
  
###### 18  
If he is uprooted from his place, it will disown him, saying, ‘I never saw you.’  
  
###### 19  
Surely this is the joy of his way; yet others will spring from the dust.  
  
###### 20  
Behold, God does not reject the blameless, nor will He strengthen the hand of evildoers.  
  
###### 21  
He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with a shout of joy.  
  
###### 22  
Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more.”
