###### 1  
So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.  
  
###### 2  
This kindled the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram. He burned with anger against Job for justifying himself rather than God,  
  
###### 3  
and he burned with anger against Job’s three friends because they had failed to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.  
  
###### 4  
Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the others were older than he.  
  
###### 5  
But when he saw that the three men had no further reply, his anger was kindled.  
  
###### 6  
So Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite declared: “I am young in years, while you are old; that is why I was timid and afraid to tell you what I know.  
  
###### 7  
I thought that age should speak, and many years should teach wisdom.  
  
###### 8  
But there is a spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding.  
  
###### 9  
It is not only the old who are wise, or the elderly who understand justice.  
  
###### 10  
Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me; I too will declare what I know.’  
  
###### 11  
Indeed, I waited while you spoke; I listened to your reasoning; as you searched for words,  
  
###### 12  
I paid you full attention. But no one proved Job wrong; not one of you rebutted his arguments.  
  
###### 13  
So do not claim, ‘We have found wisdom; let God, not man, refute him.’  
  
###### 14  
But Job has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments.  
  
###### 15  
Job’s friends are dismayed, with no more to say; words have escaped them.  
  
###### 16  
Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand and no longer reply?  
  
###### 17  
I too will answer; yes, I will declare what I know.  
  
###### 18  
For I am full of words, and my spirit within me compels me.  
  
###### 19  
Behold, my belly is like unvented wine; it is about to burst like a new wineskin.  
  
###### 20  
I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and respond.  
  
###### 21  
I will be partial to no one, nor will I flatter any man.  
  
###### 22  
For I do not know how to flatter, or my Maker would remove me in an instant.
