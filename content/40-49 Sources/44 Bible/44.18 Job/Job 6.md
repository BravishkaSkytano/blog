###### 1  
Then Job replied:  
  
###### 2  
“If only my grief could be weighed and placed with my calamity on the scales.  
  
###### 3  
For then it would outweigh the sand of the seas—no wonder my words have been rash.  
  
###### 4  
For the arrows of the Almighty have pierced me; my spirit drinks in their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me.  
  
###### 5  
Does a wild donkey bray over fresh grass, or an ox low over its fodder?  
  
###### 6  
Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the white of an egg?  
  
###### 7  
My soul refuses to touch them; they are loathsome food to me.  
  
###### 8  
If only my request were granted and God would fulfill my hope:  
  
###### 9  
that God would be willing to crush me, to unleash His hand and cut me off!  
  
###### 10  
It still brings me comfort, and joy through unrelenting pain, that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.  
  
###### 11  
What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What is my future, that I should be patient?  
  
###### 12  
Is my strength like that of stone, or my flesh made of bronze?  
  
###### 13  
Is there any help within me now that success is driven from me?  
  
###### 14  
A despairing man should have the kindness of his friend, even if he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.  
  
###### 15  
But my brothers are as faithless as wadis, as seasonal streams that overflow,  
  
###### 16  
darkened because of the ice and the inflow of melting snow,  
  
###### 17  
but ceasing in the dry season and vanishing from their channels in the heat.  
  
###### 18  
Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go into the wasteland and perish.  
  
###### 19  
The caravans of Tema look for water; the travelers of Sheba hope to find it.  
  
###### 20  
They are confounded because they had hoped; their arrival brings disappointment.  
  
###### 21  
For now you are of no help; you see terror, and you are afraid.  
  
###### 22  
Have I ever said, ‘Give me something; offer me a bribe from your wealth;  
  
###### 23  
deliver me from the hand of the enemy; redeem me from the grasp of the ruthless’?  
  
###### 24  
Teach me, and I will be silent. Help me understand how I have erred.  
  
###### 25  
How painful are honest words! But what does your argument prove?  
  
###### 26  
Do you intend to correct my words, and treat as wind my cry of despair?  
  
###### 27  
You would even cast lots for an orphan and barter away your friend.  
  
###### 28  
But now, please look at me. Would I lie to your face?  
  
###### 29  
Reconsider; do not be unjust. Reconsider, for my righteousness is at stake.  
  
###### 30  
Is there iniquity on my tongue? Can my mouth not discern malice?
