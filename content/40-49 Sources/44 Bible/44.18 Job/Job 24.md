###### 1  
“Why does the Almighty not reserve times for judgment? Why may those who know Him never see His days?  
  
###### 2  
Men move boundary stones; they pasture stolen flocks.  
  
###### 3  
They drive away the donkey of the fatherless and take the widow’s ox in pledge.  
  
###### 4  
They push the needy off the road and force all the poor of the land into hiding.  
  
###### 5  
Indeed, like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go to work foraging for food; the wasteland is food for their children.  
  
###### 6  
They gather fodder in the fields and glean the vineyards of the wicked.  
  
###### 7  
Without clothing, they spend the night naked; they have no covering against the cold.  
  
###### 8  
Drenched by mountain rains, they huddle against the rocks for want of shelter.  
  
###### 9  
The fatherless infant is snatched from the breast; the nursing child of the poor is seized for a debt.  
  
###### 10  
Without clothing, they wander about naked. They carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.  
  
###### 11  
They crush olives within their walls; they tread the winepresses, but go thirsty.  
  
###### 12  
From the city, men groan, and the souls of the wounded cry out, yet God charges no one with wrongdoing.  
  
###### 13  
Then there are those who rebel against the light, not knowing its ways or staying on its paths.  
  
###### 14  
When daylight is gone, the murderer rises to kill the poor and needy; in the night he is like a thief.  
  
###### 15  
The eye of the adulterer watches for twilight. Thinking, ‘No eye will see me,’ he covers his face.  
  
###### 16  
In the dark they dig through houses; by day they shut themselves in, never to experience the light.  
  
###### 17  
For to them, deep darkness is their morning; surely they are friends with the terrors of darkness!  
  
###### 18  
They are but foam on the surface of the water; their portion of the land is cursed, so that no one turns toward their vineyards.  
  
###### 19  
As drought and heat consume the melting snow, so Sheol steals those who have sinned.  
  
###### 20  
The womb forgets them; the worm feeds on them; they are remembered no more. So injustice is like a broken tree.  
  
###### 21  
They prey on the barren and childless, and show no kindness to the widow.  
  
###### 22  
Yet by His power, God drags away the mighty; though rising up, they have no assurance of life.  
  
###### 23  
He gives them a sense of security, but His eyes are on their ways.  
  
###### 24  
They are exalted for a moment, then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like heads of grain.  
  
###### 25  
If this is not so, then who can prove me a liar and reduce my words to nothing?”
