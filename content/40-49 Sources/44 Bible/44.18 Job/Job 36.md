###### 1  
And Elihu continued:  
  
###### 2  
“Bear with me a little longer, and I will show you that there is more to be said on God’s behalf.  
  
###### 3  
I get my knowledge from afar, and I will ascribe justice to my Maker.  
  
###### 4  
For truly my words are free of falsehood; one perfect in knowledge is with you.  
  
###### 5  
Indeed, God is mighty, but He despises no one; He is mighty in strength of understanding.  
  
###### 6  
He does not keep the wicked alive, but He grants justice to the afflicted.  
  
###### 7  
He does not take His eyes off the righteous, but He enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.  
  
###### 8  
And if men are bound with chains, caught in cords of affliction,  
  
###### 9  
then He tells them their deeds and how arrogantly they have transgressed.  
  
###### 10  
He opens their ears to correction and commands that they turn from iniquity.  
  
###### 11  
If they obey and serve Him, then they end their days in prosperity and their years in happiness.  
  
###### 12  
But if they do not obey, then they perish by the sword and die without knowledge.  
  
###### 13  
The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when He binds them, they do not cry for help.  
  
###### 14  
They die in their youth, among the male shrine prostitutes.  
  
###### 15  
God rescues the afflicted by their affliction and opens their ears in oppression.  
  
###### 16  
Indeed, He drew you from the jaws of distress to a spacious and broad place, to a table full of richness.  
  
###### 17  
But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have seized you.  
  
###### 18  
Be careful that no one lures you with riches; do not let a large bribe lead you astray.  
  
###### 19  
Can your wealth or all your mighty effort keep you from distress?  
  
###### 20  
Do not long for the night, when people vanish from their homes.  
  
###### 21  
Be careful not to turn to iniquity, for this you have preferred to affliction.  
  
###### 22  
Behold, God is exalted in His power. Who is a teacher like Him?  
  
###### 23  
Who has appointed His way for Him, or told Him, ‘You have done wrong’?  
  
###### 24  
Remember to magnify His work, which men have praised in song.  
  
###### 25  
All mankind has seen it; men behold it from afar.  
  
###### 26  
Indeed, God is great—beyond our knowledge; the number of His years is unsearchable.  
  
###### 27  
For He draws up drops of water which distill the rain from the mist,  
  
###### 28  
which the clouds pour out and shower abundantly on mankind.  
  
###### 29  
Furthermore, who can understand how the clouds spread out, how the thunder roars from His pavilion?  
  
###### 30  
See how He scatters His lightning around Him and covers the depths of the sea.  
  
###### 31  
For by these He judges the nations and provides food in abundance.  
  
###### 32  
He fills His hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark.  
  
###### 33  
The thunder declares His presence; even the cattle regard the rising storm.
