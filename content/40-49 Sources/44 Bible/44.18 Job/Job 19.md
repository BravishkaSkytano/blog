###### 1  
Then Job answered:  
  
###### 2  
“How long will you torment me and crush me with your words?  
  
###### 3  
Ten times now you have reproached me; you shamelessly mistreat me.  
  
###### 4  
Even if I have truly gone astray, my error concerns me alone.  
  
###### 5  
If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my disgrace against me,  
  
###### 6  
then understand that it is God who has wronged me and drawn His net around me.  
  
###### 7  
Though I cry out, ‘Violence!’ I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice.  
  
###### 8  
He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; He has veiled my paths with darkness.  
  
###### 9  
He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.  
  
###### 10  
He tears me down on every side until I am gone; He uproots my hope like a tree.  
  
###### 11  
His anger burns against me, and He counts me among His enemies.  
  
###### 12  
His troops advance together; they construct a ramp against me and encamp around my tent.  
  
###### 13  
He has removed my brothers from me; my acquaintances have abandoned me.  
  
###### 14  
My kinsmen have failed me, and my friends have forgotten me.  
  
###### 15  
My guests and maidservants count me as a stranger; I am a foreigner in their sight.  
  
###### 16  
I call for my servant, but he does not answer, though I implore him with my own mouth.  
  
###### 17  
My breath is repulsive to my wife, and I am loathsome to my own family.  
  
###### 18  
Even little boys scorn me; when I appear, they deride me.  
  
###### 19  
All my best friends despise me, and those I love have turned against me.  
  
###### 20  
My skin and flesh cling to my bones; I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.  
  
###### 21  
Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me.  
  
###### 22  
Why do you persecute me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh?  
  
###### 23  
I wish that my words were recorded and inscribed in a book,  
  
###### 24  
by an iron stylus on lead, or chiseled in stone forever.  
  
###### 25  
But I know that my Redeemer lives, and in the end He will stand upon the earth.  
  
###### 26  
Even after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God.  
  
###### 27  
I will see Him for myself; my eyes will behold Him, and not as a stranger. How my heart yearns within me!  
  
###### 28  
If you say, ‘Let us persecute him, since the root of the matter lies with him,’  
  
###### 29  
then you should fear the sword yourselves, because wrath brings punishment by the sword, so that you may know there is a judgment.”
