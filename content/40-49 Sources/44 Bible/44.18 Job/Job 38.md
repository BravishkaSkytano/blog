###### 1  
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:  
  
###### 2  
“Who is this who obscures My counsel by words without knowledge?  
  
###### 3  
Now brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall inform Me.  
  
###### 4  
Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell Me, if you have understanding.  
  
###### 5  
Who fixed its measurements? Surely you know! Or who stretched a measuring line across it?  
  
###### 6  
On what were its foundations set, or who laid its cornerstone,  
  
###### 7  
while the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?  
  
###### 8  
Who enclosed the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb,  
  
###### 9  
when I made the clouds its garment and thick darkness its blanket,  
  
###### 10  
when I fixed its boundaries and set in place its bars and doors,  
  
###### 11  
and I declared: ‘You may come this far, but no farther; here your proud waves must stop’?  
  
###### 12  
In your days, have you commanded the morning or assigned the dawn its place,  
  
###### 13  
that it might spread to the ends of the earth and shake the wicked out of it?  
  
###### 14  
The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its hills stand out like the folds of a garment.  
  
###### 15  
Light is withheld from the wicked, and their upraised arm is broken.  
  
###### 16  
Have you journeyed to the vents of the sea or walked in the trenches of the deep?  
  
###### 17  
Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?  
  
###### 18  
Have you surveyed the extent of the earth? Tell Me, if you know all this.  
  
###### 19  
Where is the way to the home of light? Do you know where darkness resides,  
  
###### 20  
so you can lead it back to its border? Do you know the paths to its home?  
  
###### 21  
Surely you know, for you were already born! And the number of your days is great!  
  
###### 22  
Have you entered the storehouses of snow or observed the storehouses of hail,  
  
###### 23  
which I hold in reserve for times of trouble, for the day of war and battle?  
  
###### 24  
In which direction is the lightning dispersed, or the east wind scattered over the earth?  
  
###### 25  
Who cuts a channel for the flood or clears a path for the thunderbolt,  
  
###### 26  
to bring rain on a barren land, on a desert where no man lives,  
  
###### 27  
to satisfy the parched wasteland and make it sprout with tender grass?  
  
###### 28  
Does the rain have a father? Who has begotten the drops of dew?  
  
###### 29  
From whose womb does the ice emerge? Who gives birth to the frost from heaven,  
  
###### 30  
when the waters become hard as stone and the surface of the deep is frozen?  
  
###### 31  
Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loosen the belt of Orion?  
  
###### 32  
Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons or lead out the Bear and her cubs?  
  
###### 33  
Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set their dominion over the earth?  
  
###### 34  
Can you command the clouds so that a flood of water covers you?  
  
###### 35  
Can you send the lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, ‘Here we are’?  
  
###### 36  
Who has put wisdom in the heart or given understanding to the mind?  
  
###### 37  
Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Or who can tilt the water jars of the heavens  
  
###### 38  
when the dust hardens into a mass and the clods of earth stick together?  
  
###### 39  
Can you hunt the prey for a lioness or satisfy the hunger of young lions  
  
###### 40  
when they crouch in their dens and lie in wait in the thicket?  
  
###### 41  
Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God as they wander about for lack of food?
