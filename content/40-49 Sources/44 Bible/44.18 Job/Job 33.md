###### 1  
“But now, O Job, hear my speech, and listen to all my words.  
  
###### 2  
Behold, I will open my mouth; my address is on the tip of my tongue.  
  
###### 3  
My words are from an upright heart, and my lips speak sincerely what I know.  
  
###### 4  
The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.  
  
###### 5  
Refute me if you can; prepare your case and confront me.  
  
###### 6  
I am just like you before God; I was also formed from clay.  
  
###### 7  
Surely no fear of me should terrify you; nor will my hand be heavy upon you.  
  
###### 8  
Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard these very words:  
  
###### 9  
‘I am pure, without transgression; I am clean, with no iniquity in me.  
  
###### 10  
Yet God finds occasions against me; He counts me as His enemy.  
  
###### 11  
He puts my feet in the stocks; He watches over all my paths.’  
  
###### 12  
Behold, you are not right in this matter. I will answer you, for God is greater than man.  
  
###### 13  
Why do you complain to Him that He answers nothing a man asks?  
  
###### 14  
For God speaks in one way and in another, yet no one notices.  
  
###### 15  
In a dream, in a vision in the night, when deep sleep falls upon men as they slumber on their beds,  
  
###### 16  
He opens their ears and terrifies them with warnings  
  
###### 17  
to turn a man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride,  
  
###### 18  
to preserve his soul from the Pit and his life from perishing by the sword.  
  
###### 19  
A man is also chastened on his bed with pain and constant distress in his bones,  
  
###### 20  
so that he detests his bread, and his soul loathes his favorite food.  
  
###### 21  
His flesh wastes away from sight, and his hidden bones protrude.  
  
###### 22  
He draws near to the Pit, and his life to the messengers of death.  
  
###### 23  
Yet if there is a messenger on his side, one mediator in a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him,  
  
###### 24  
to be gracious to him and say, ‘Spare him from going down to the Pit; I have found his ransom,’  
  
###### 25  
then his flesh is refreshed like a child’s; he returns to the days of his youth.  
  
###### 26  
He prays to God and finds favor; he sees God’s face and shouts for joy, and God restores His righteousness to that man.  
  
###### 27  
Then he sings before men with these words: ‘I have sinned and perverted what was right; yet I did not get what I deserved.  
  
###### 28  
He redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit, and I will live to see the light.’  
  
###### 29  
Behold, all these things God does to a man, two or even three times,  
  
###### 30  
to bring back his soul from the Pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of life.  
  
###### 31  
Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.  
  
###### 32  
But if you have something to say, answer me; speak up, for I would like to vindicate you.  
  
###### 33  
But if not, then listen to me; be quiet, and I will teach you wisdom.”
