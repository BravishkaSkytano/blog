###### 1  
“I loathe my own life; I will express my complaint and speak in the bitterness of my soul.  
  
###### 2  
I will say to God: Do not condemn me! Let me know why You prosecute me.  
  
###### 3  
Does it please You to oppress me, to reject the work of Your hands and favor the schemes of the wicked?  
  
###### 4  
Do You have eyes of flesh? Do You see as man sees?  
  
###### 5  
Are Your days like those of a mortal, or Your years like those of a man,  
  
###### 6  
that You should seek my iniquity and search out my sin—  
  
###### 7  
though You know that I am not guilty, and there is no deliverance from Your hand?  
  
###### 8  
Your hands shaped me and altogether formed me. Would You now turn and destroy me?  
  
###### 9  
Please remember that You molded me like clay. Would You now return me to dust?  
  
###### 10  
Did You not pour me out like milk, and curdle me like cheese?  
  
###### 11  
You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews.  
  
###### 12  
You have granted me life and loving devotion, and Your care has preserved my spirit.  
  
###### 13  
Yet You concealed these things in Your heart, and I know that this was in Your mind:  
  
###### 14  
If I sinned, You would take note, and would not acquit me of my iniquity.  
  
###### 15  
If I am guilty, woe to me! And even if I am righteous, I cannot lift my head. I am full of shame and aware of my affliction.  
  
###### 16  
Should I hold my head high, You would hunt me like a lion, and again display Your power against me.  
  
###### 17  
You produce new witnesses against me and multiply Your anger toward me. Hardships assault me in wave after wave.  
  
###### 18  
Why then did You bring me from the womb? Oh, that I had died, and no eye had seen me!  
  
###### 19  
If only I had never come to be, but had been carried from the womb to the grave.  
  
###### 20  
Are my days not few? Withdraw from me, that I may have a little comfort,  
  
###### 21  
before I go—never to return—to a land of darkness and gloom,  
  
###### 22  
to a land of utter darkness, of deep shadow and disorder, where even the light is like darkness.”
