###### 1  
Then Job answered:  
  
###### 2  
“How you have helped the powerless and saved the arm that is feeble!  
  
###### 3  
How you have counseled the unwise and provided fully sound insight!  
  
###### 4  
To whom have you uttered these words? And whose spirit spoke through you?  
  
###### 5  
The dead tremble—those beneath the waters and those who dwell in them.  
  
###### 6  
Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering.  
  
###### 7  
He stretches out the north over empty space; He hangs the earth upon nothing.  
  
###### 8  
He wraps up the waters in His clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their own weight.  
  
###### 9  
He covers the face of the full moon, spreading over it His cloud.  
  
###### 10  
He has inscribed a horizon on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.  
  
###### 11  
The foundations of heaven quake, astounded at His rebuke.  
  
###### 12  
By His power He stirred the sea; by His understanding He shattered Rahab.  
  
###### 13  
By His breath the skies were cleared; His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.  
  
###### 14  
Indeed, these are but the fringes of His ways; how faint is the whisper we hear of Him! Who then can understand the thunder of His power?”
