###### 1  
“Do you know when mountain goats give birth? Have you watched the doe bear her fawn?  
  
###### 2  
Can you count the months they are pregnant? Do you know the time they give birth?  
  
###### 3  
They crouch down and bring forth their young; they deliver their newborn.  
  
###### 4  
Their young ones thrive and grow up in the open field; they leave and do not return.  
  
###### 5  
Who set the wild donkey free? Who released the swift donkey from the harness?  
  
###### 6  
I made the wilderness his home and the salt flats his dwelling.  
  
###### 7  
He scorns the tumult of the city and never hears the shouts of a driver.  
  
###### 8  
He roams the mountains for pasture, searching for any green thing.  
  
###### 9  
Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will he stay by your manger at night?  
  
###### 10  
Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness? Will he plow the valleys behind you?  
  
###### 11  
Can you rely on his great strength? Will you leave your hard work to him?  
  
###### 12  
Can you trust him to bring in your grain and gather it to your threshing floor?  
  
###### 13  
The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but cannot match the pinions and feathers of the stork.  
  
###### 14  
For she leaves her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand.  
  
###### 15  
She forgets that a foot may crush them, or a wild animal may trample them.  
  
###### 16  
She treats her young harshly, as if not her own, with no concern that her labor was in vain.  
  
###### 17  
For God has deprived her of wisdom; He has not endowed her with understanding.  
  
###### 18  
Yet when she proudly spreads her wings, she laughs at the horse and its rider.  
  
###### 19  
Do you give strength to the horse or adorn his neck with a mane?  
  
###### 20  
Do you make him leap like a locust, striking terror with his proud snorting?  
  
###### 21  
He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength; he charges into battle.  
  
###### 22  
He laughs at fear, frightened of nothing; he does not turn back from the sword.  
  
###### 23  
A quiver rattles at his side, along with a flashing spear and lance.  
  
###### 24  
Trembling with excitement, he devours the distance; he cannot stand still when the ram’s horn sounds.  
  
###### 25  
At the blast of the horn, he snorts with fervor. He catches the scent of battle from afar—the shouts of captains and the cry of war.  
  
###### 26  
Does the hawk take flight by your understanding and spread his wings toward the south?  
  
###### 27  
Does the eagle soar at your command and make his nest on high?  
  
###### 28  
He dwells on a cliff and lodges there; his stronghold is on a rocky crag.  
  
###### 29  
From there he spies out food; his eyes see it from afar.  
  
###### 30  
His young ones feast on blood; and where the slain are, there he is.”
