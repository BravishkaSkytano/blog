###### 1  
Then Job answered:  
  
###### 2  
“Even today my complaint is bitter. His hand is heavy despite my groaning.  
  
###### 3  
If only I knew where to find Him, so that I could go to His seat.  
  
###### 4  
I would plead my case before Him and fill my mouth with arguments.  
  
###### 5  
I would learn how He would answer, and consider what He would say.  
  
###### 6  
Would He contend with me in His great power? No, He would certainly take note of me.  
  
###### 7  
Then an upright man could reason with Him, and I would be delivered forever from my Judge.  
  
###### 8  
If I go east, He is not there, and if I go west, I cannot find Him.  
  
###### 9  
When He is at work in the north, I cannot behold Him; when He turns to the south, I cannot see Him.  
  
###### 10  
Yet He knows the way I have taken; when He has tested me, I will come forth as gold.  
  
###### 11  
My feet have followed in His tracks; I have kept His way without turning aside.  
  
###### 12  
I have not departed from the command of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread.  
  
###### 13  
But He is unchangeable, and who can oppose Him? He does what He desires.  
  
###### 14  
For He carries out His decree against me, and He has many such plans.  
  
###### 15  
Therefore I am terrified in His presence; when I consider this, I fear Him.  
  
###### 16  
God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.  
  
###### 17  
Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face.
