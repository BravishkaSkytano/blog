###### 1  
Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:  
  
###### 2  
“If one ventures a word with you, will you be wearied? Yet who can keep from speaking?  
  
###### 3  
Surely you have instructed many, and have strengthened their feeble hands.  
  
###### 4  
Your words have steadied those who stumbled; you have braced the knees that were buckling.  
  
###### 5  
But now trouble has come upon you, and you are weary. It strikes you, and you are dismayed.  
  
###### 6  
Is your reverence not your confidence, and the uprightness of your ways your hope?  
  
###### 7  
Consider now, I plead: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Or where have the upright been destroyed?  
  
###### 8  
As I have observed, those who plow iniquity and those who sow trouble reap the same.  
  
###### 9  
By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of His anger they are consumed.  
  
###### 10  
The lion may roar, and the fierce lion may growl, yet the teeth of the young lions are broken.  
  
###### 11  
The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.  
  
###### 12  
Now a word came to me secretly; my ears caught a whisper of it.  
  
###### 13  
In disquieting visions in the night, when deep sleep falls on men,  
  
###### 14  
fear and trembling came over me and made all my bones shudder.  
  
###### 15  
Then a spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body bristled.  
  
###### 16  
It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; a form loomed before my eyes, and I heard a whispering voice:  
  
###### 17  
‘Can a mortal be more righteous than God, or a man more pure than his Maker?  
  
###### 18  
If God puts no trust in His servants, and He charges His angels with error,  
  
###### 19  
how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who can be crushed like a moth!  
  
###### 20  
They are smashed to pieces from dawn to dusk; unnoticed, they perish forever.  
  
###### 21  
Are not their tent cords pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?’
