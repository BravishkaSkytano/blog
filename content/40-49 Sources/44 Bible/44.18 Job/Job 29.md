###### 1  
And Job continued his discourse:  
  
###### 2  
“How I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me,  
  
###### 3  
when His lamp shone above my head, and by His light I walked through the darkness,  
  
###### 4  
when I was in my prime, when the friendship of God rested on my tent,  
  
###### 5  
when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me,  
  
###### 6  
when my steps were bathed in cream and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!  
  
###### 7  
When I went out to the city gate and took my seat in the public square,  
  
###### 8  
the young men saw me and withdrew, and the old men rose to their feet.  
  
###### 9  
The princes refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands.  
  
###### 10  
The voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths.  
  
###### 11  
For those who heard me called me blessed, and those who saw me commended me,  
  
###### 12  
because I rescued the poor who cried out and the fatherless who had no helper.  
  
###### 13  
The dying man blessed me, and I made the widow’s heart sing for joy.  
  
###### 14  
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; justice was my robe and my turban.  
  
###### 15  
I served as eyes to the blind and as feet to the lame.  
  
###### 16  
I was a father to the needy, and I took up the case of the stranger.  
  
###### 17  
I shattered the fangs of the unjust and snatched the prey from his teeth.  
  
###### 18  
So I thought: ‘I will die in my nest and multiply my days as the sand.  
  
###### 19  
My roots will spread out to the waters, and the dew will rest nightly on my branches.  
  
###### 20  
My glory is ever new within me, and my bow is renewed in my hand.’  
  
###### 21  
Men listened to me with expectation, waiting silently for my counsel.  
  
###### 22  
After my words, they spoke no more; my speech settled on them like dew.  
  
###### 23  
They waited for me as for rain and drank in my words like spring showers.  
  
###### 24  
If I smiled at them, they did not believe it; the light of my countenance was precious.  
  
###### 25  
I chose their course and presided as chief. So I dwelt as a king among his troops, as a comforter of the mourners.
