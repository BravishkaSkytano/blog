###### 1  
“Call out if you please, but who will answer? To which of the holy ones will you turn?  
  
###### 2  
For resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple.  
  
###### 3  
I have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed.  
  
###### 4  
His sons are far from safety, crushed in court without a defender.  
  
###### 5  
The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from the thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.  
  
###### 6  
For distress does not spring from the dust, and trouble does not sprout from the ground.  
  
###### 7  
Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward.  
  
###### 8  
However, if I were you, I would appeal to God and lay my cause before Him—  
  
###### 9  
the One who does great and unsearchable things, wonders without number.  
  
###### 10  
He gives rain to the earth and sends water upon the fields.  
  
###### 11  
He sets the lowly on high, so that mourners are lifted to safety.  
  
###### 12  
He thwarts the schemes of the crafty, so that their hands find no success.  
  
###### 13  
He catches the wise in their craftiness, and sweeps away the plans of the cunning.  
  
###### 14  
They encounter darkness by day and grope at noon as in the night.  
  
###### 15  
He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth and from the clutches of the powerful.  
  
###### 16  
So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth.  
  
###### 17  
Blessed indeed is the man whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.  
  
###### 18  
For He wounds, but He also binds; He strikes, but His hands also heal.  
  
###### 19  
He will rescue you from six calamities; no harm will touch you in seven.  
  
###### 20  
In famine He will redeem you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword.  
  
###### 21  
You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, and will not fear havoc when it comes.  
  
###### 22  
You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the beasts of the earth.  
  
###### 23  
For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.  
  
###### 24  
You will know that your tent is secure, and find nothing amiss when inspecting your home.  
  
###### 25  
You will know that your offspring will be many, your descendants like the grass of the earth.  
  
###### 26  
You will come to the grave in full vigor, like a sheaf of grain gathered in season.  
  
###### 27  
Indeed, we have investigated, and it is true! So hear it and know for yourself.”
