###### 1  
And the LORD said to Job:  
  
###### 2  
“Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty? Let him who argues with God give an answer.”  
  
###### 3  
Then Job answered the LORD:  
  
###### 4  
“Behold, I am insignificant. How can I reply to You? I place my hand over my mouth.  
  
###### 5  
I have spoken once, but I have no answer—twice, but I have nothing to add.”  
  
###### 6  
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:  
  
###### 7  
“Now brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall inform Me.  
  
###### 8  
Would you really annul My justice? Would you condemn Me to justify yourself?  
  
###### 9  
Do you have an arm like God’s? Can you thunder with a voice like His?  
  
###### 10  
Then adorn yourself with majesty and splendor, and clothe yourself with honor and glory.  
  
###### 11  
Unleash the fury of your wrath; look on every proud man and bring him low.  
  
###### 12  
Look on every proud man and humble him; trample the wicked where they stand.  
  
###### 13  
Bury them together in the dust; imprison them in the grave.  
  
###### 14  
Then I will confess to you that your own right hand can save you.  
  
###### 15  
Look at Behemoth, which I made along with you. He feeds on grass like an ox.  
  
###### 16  
See the strength of his loins and the power in the muscles of his belly.  
  
###### 17  
His tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are tightly knit.  
  
###### 18  
His bones are tubes of bronze; his limbs are rods of iron.  
  
###### 19  
He is the foremost of God’s works; only his Maker can draw the sword against him.  
  
###### 20  
The hills yield him their produce, while all the beasts of the field play nearby.  
  
###### 21  
He lies under the lotus plants, hidden among the reeds of the marsh.  
  
###### 22  
The lotus plants conceal him in their shade; the willows of the brook surround him.  
  
###### 23  
Though the river rages, Behemoth is unafraid; he remains secure, though the Jordan surges to his mouth.  
  
###### 24  
Can anyone capture him as he looks on, or pierce his nose with a snare?
