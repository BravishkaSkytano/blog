###### 1  
Job continued his discourse:  
  
###### 2  
“As surely as God lives, who has deprived me of justice—the Almighty, who has embittered my soul—  
  
###### 3  
as long as my breath is still within me and the breath of God remains in my nostrils,  
  
###### 4  
my lips will not speak wickedness, and my tongue will not utter deceit.  
  
###### 5  
I will never say that you are right; I will maintain my integrity until I die.  
  
###### 6  
I will cling to my righteousness and never let go. As long as I live, my conscience will not accuse me.  
  
###### 7  
May my enemy be like the wicked and my opponent like the unjust.  
  
###### 8  
For what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?  
  
###### 9  
Will God hear his cry when distress comes upon him?  
  
###### 10  
Will he delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?  
  
###### 11  
I will instruct you in the power of God. I will not conceal the ways of the Almighty.  
  
###### 12  
Surely all of you have seen it for yourselves. Why then do you keep up this empty talk?  
  
###### 13  
This is the wicked man’s portion from God—the heritage the ruthless receive from the Almighty.  
  
###### 14  
Though his sons are many, they are destined for the sword; and his offspring will never have enough food.  
  
###### 15  
His survivors will be buried by the plague, and their widows will not weep for them.  
  
###### 16  
Though he heaps up silver like dust and piles up a wardrobe like clay,  
  
###### 17  
what he lays up, the righteous will wear, and his silver will be divided by the innocent.  
  
###### 18  
The house he built is like a moth’s cocoon, like a hut set up by a watchman.  
  
###### 19  
He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone.  
  
###### 20  
Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest sweeps him away in the night.  
  
###### 21  
The east wind carries him away, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.  
  
###### 22  
It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power.  
  
###### 23  
It claps its hands at him and hisses him out of his place.
