###### 1  
Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:  
  
###### 2  
“How long until you end these speeches? Show some sense, and then we can talk.  
  
###### 3  
Why are we regarded as cattle, as stupid in your sight?  
  
###### 4  
You who tear yourself in anger—should the earth be forsaken on your account, or the rocks be moved from their place?  
  
###### 5  
Indeed, the lamp of the wicked is extinguished; the flame of his fire does not glow.  
  
###### 6  
The light in his tent grows dark, and the lamp beside him goes out.  
  
###### 7  
His vigorous stride is shortened, and his own schemes trip him up.  
  
###### 8  
For his own feet lead him into a net, and he wanders into its mesh.  
  
###### 9  
A trap seizes his heel; a snare grips him.  
  
###### 10  
A noose is hidden in the ground, and a trap lies in his path.  
  
###### 11  
Terrors frighten him on every side and harass his every step.  
  
###### 12  
His strength is depleted, and calamity is ready at his side.  
  
###### 13  
It devours patches of his skin; the firstborn of death devours his limbs.  
  
###### 14  
He is torn from the shelter of his tent and is marched off to the king of terrors.  
  
###### 15  
Fire resides in his tent; burning sulfur rains down on his dwelling.  
  
###### 16  
The roots beneath him dry up, and the branches above him wither away.  
  
###### 17  
The memory of him perishes from the earth, and he has no name in the land.  
  
###### 18  
He is driven from light into darkness and is chased from the inhabited world.  
  
###### 19  
He has no offspring or posterity among his people, no survivor where he once lived.  
  
###### 20  
Those in the west are appalled at his fate, while those in the east tremble in horror.  
  
###### 21  
Surely such is the dwelling of the wicked and the place of one who does not know God.”
