###### 1  
“Man, who is born of woman, is short of days and full of trouble.  
  
###### 2  
Like a flower, he comes forth, then withers away; like a fleeting shadow, he does not endure.  
  
###### 3  
Do You open Your eyes to one like this? Will You bring him into judgment before You?  
  
###### 4  
Who can bring out clean from unclean? No one!  
  
###### 5  
Since his days are determined and the number of his months is with You, and since You have set limits that he cannot exceed,  
  
###### 6  
look away from him and let him rest, so he can enjoy his day as a hired hand.  
  
###### 7  
For there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its tender shoots will not fail.  
  
###### 8  
If its roots grow old in the ground and its stump dies in the soil,  
  
###### 9  
at the scent of water it will bud and put forth twigs like a sapling.  
  
###### 10  
But a man dies and is laid low; he breathes his last, and where is he?  
  
###### 11  
As water disappears from the sea and a river becomes parched and dry,  
  
###### 12  
so a man lies down and does not rise. Until the heavens are no more, he will not be awakened or roused from sleep.  
  
###### 13  
If only You would hide me in Sheol and conceal me until Your anger has passed! If only You would appoint a time for me and then remember me!  
  
###### 14  
When a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait, until my renewal comes.  
  
###### 15  
You will call, and I will answer; You will desire the work of Your hands.  
  
###### 16  
For then You would count my steps, but would not keep track of my sin.  
  
###### 17  
My transgression would be sealed in a bag, and You would cover over my iniquity.  
  
###### 18  
But as a mountain erodes and crumbles and a rock is dislodged from its place,  
  
###### 19  
as water wears away the stones and torrents wash away the soil, so You destroy a man’s hope.  
  
###### 20  
You forever overpower him, and he passes on; You change his countenance and send him away.  
  
###### 21  
If his sons receive honor, he does not know it; if they are brought low, he is unaware.  
  
###### 22  
He feels only the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself.”
