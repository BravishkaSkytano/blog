###### 1  
“Is not man consigned to labor on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired hand?  
  
###### 2  
Like a slave he longs for shade; like a hireling he waits for his wages.  
  
###### 3  
So I am allotted months of futility, and nights of misery are appointed me.  
  
###### 4  
When I lie down I think: ‘When will I get up?’ But the night drags on, and I toss and turn until dawn.  
  
###### 5  
My flesh is clothed with worms and encrusted with dirt; my skin is cracked and festering.  
  
###### 6  
My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle; they come to an end without hope.  
  
###### 7  
Remember that my life is but a breath. My eyes will never again see happiness.  
  
###### 8  
The eye that beholds me will no longer see me. You will look for me, but I will be no more.  
  
###### 9  
As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come back up.  
  
###### 10  
He never returns to his house; his place remembers him no more.  
  
###### 11  
Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.  
  
###### 12  
Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep, that You must keep me under guard?  
  
###### 13  
When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint,  
  
###### 14  
then You frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions,  
  
###### 15  
so that I would prefer strangling and death over my life in this body.  
  
###### 16  
I loathe my life! I would not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath.  
  
###### 17  
What is man that You should exalt him, that You should set Your heart upon him,  
  
###### 18  
that You attend to him every morning, and test him every moment?  
  
###### 19  
Will You never look away from me, or leave me alone to swallow my spittle?  
  
###### 20  
If I have sinned, what have I done to You, O watcher of mankind? Why have You made me Your target, so that I am a burden to You?  
  
###### 21  
Why do You not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity? For soon I will lie down in the dust; You will seek me, but I will be no more.”
