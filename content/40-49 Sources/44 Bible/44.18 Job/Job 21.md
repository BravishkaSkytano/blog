###### 1  
Then Job answered:  
  
###### 2  
“Listen carefully to my words; let this be your consolation to me.  
  
###### 3  
Bear with me while I speak; then, after I have spoken, you may go on mocking.  
  
###### 4  
Is my complaint against a man? Then why should I not be impatient?  
  
###### 5  
Look at me and be appalled; put your hand over your mouth.  
  
###### 6  
When I remember, terror takes hold, and my body trembles in horror.  
  
###### 7  
Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power?  
  
###### 8  
Their descendants are established around them, and their offspring before their eyes.  
  
###### 9  
Their homes are safe from fear; no rod of punishment from God is upon them.  
  
###### 10  
Their bulls breed without fail; their cows bear calves and do not miscarry.  
  
###### 11  
They send forth their little ones like a flock; their children skip about,  
  
###### 12  
singing to the tambourine and lyre and making merry at the sound of the flute.  
  
###### 13  
They spend their days in prosperity and go down to Sheol in peace.  
  
###### 14  
Yet they say to God: ‘Leave us alone! For we have no desire to know Your ways.  
  
###### 15  
Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him, and what would we gain if we pray to Him?’  
  
###### 16  
Still, their prosperity is not in their own hands, so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked.  
  
###### 17  
How often is the lamp of the wicked put out? Does disaster come upon them? Does God, in His anger, apportion destruction?  
  
###### 18  
Are they like straw before the wind, like chaff swept away by a storm?  
  
###### 19  
It is said that God lays up one’s punishment for his children. Let God repay the man himself, so he will know it.  
  
###### 20  
Let his eyes see his own destruction; let him drink for himself the wrath of the Almighty.  
  
###### 21  
For what does he care about his household after him, when the number of his months has run out?  
  
###### 22  
Can anyone teach knowledge to God, since He judges those on high?  
  
###### 23  
One man dies full of vigor, completely secure and at ease.  
  
###### 24  
His body is well nourished, and his bones are rich with marrow.  
  
###### 25  
Yet another man dies in the bitterness of his soul, having never tasted prosperity.  
  
###### 26  
But together they lie down in the dust, and worms cover them both.  
  
###### 27  
Behold, I know your thoughts full well, the schemes by which you would wrong me.  
  
###### 28  
For you say, ‘Where now is the nobleman’s house, and where are the tents in which the wicked dwell?’  
  
###### 29  
Have you never asked those who travel the roads? Do you not accept their reports?  
  
###### 30  
Indeed, the evil man is spared from the day of calamity, delivered from the day of wrath.  
  
###### 31  
Who denounces his behavior to his face? Who repays him for what he has done?  
  
###### 32  
He is carried to the grave, and watch is kept over his tomb.  
  
###### 33  
The clods of the valley are sweet to him; everyone follows behind him, and those before him are without number.  
  
###### 34  
So how can you comfort me with empty words? For your answers remain full of falsehood.”
