###### 1  
And Elihu went on to say:  
  
###### 2  
“Do you think this is just? You say, ‘I am more righteous than God.’  
  
###### 3  
For you ask, ‘What does it profit me, and what benefit do I gain apart from sin?’  
  
###### 4  
I will reply to you and to your friends as well.  
  
###### 5  
Look to the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds high above you.  
  
###### 6  
If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him? If you multiply your transgressions, what do you do to Him?  
  
###### 7  
If you are righteous, what do you give Him, or what does He receive from your hand?  
  
###### 8  
Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself, and your righteousness only a son of man.  
  
###### 9

###### 10  
But no one asks, ‘Where is God my Maker, who gives us songs in the night,  
  
###### 11  
who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?’  
  
###### 12  
There they cry out, but He does not answer, because of the pride of evil men.  
  
###### 13  
Surely God does not listen to empty pleas, and the Almighty does not take note of it.  
  
###### 14  
How much less, then, when you say that you do not see Him, that your case is before Him and you must wait for Him,  
  
###### 15  
and further, that in His anger He has not punished or taken much notice of folly!  
  
###### 16  
So Job opens his mouth in vain and multiplies words without knowledge.”
