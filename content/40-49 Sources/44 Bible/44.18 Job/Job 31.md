###### 1  
“I have made a covenant with my eyes. How then could I gaze with desire at a virgin?  
  
###### 2  
For what is the allotment of God from above, or the heritage from the Almighty on high?  
  
###### 3  
Does not disaster come to the unjust and calamity to the workers of iniquity?  
  
###### 4  
Does He not see my ways and count my every step?  
  
###### 5  
If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has rushed to deceit,  
  
###### 6  
let God weigh me with honest scales, that He may know my integrity.  
  
###### 7  
If my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has followed my eyes, or if impurity has stuck to my hands,  
  
###### 8  
then may another eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted.  
  
###### 9  
If my heart has been enticed by my neighbor’s wife, or I have lurked at his door,  
  
###### 10  
then may my own wife grind grain for another, and may other men sleep with her.  
  
###### 11  
For that would be a heinous crime, an iniquity to be judged.  
  
###### 12  
For it is a fire that burns down to Abaddon; it would root out my entire harvest.  
  
###### 13  
If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or maidservant when they made a complaint against me,  
  
###### 14  
what will I do when God rises to judge? How will I answer when called to account?  
  
###### 15  
Did not He who made me in the womb also make them? Did not the same One form us in the womb?  
  
###### 16  
If I have denied the desires of the poor or allowed the widow’s eyes to fail,  
  
###### 17  
if I have eaten my morsel alone, not sharing it with the fatherless—  
  
###### 18  
though from my youth I reared him as would a father, and from my mother’s womb I guided the widow—  
  
###### 19  
if I have seen one perish for lack of clothing, or a needy man without a cloak,  
  
###### 20  
if his heart has not blessed me for warming him with the fleece of my sheep,  
  
###### 21  
if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless because I saw that I had support in the gate,  
  
###### 22  
then may my arm fall from my shoulder and be torn from its socket.  
  
###### 23  
For calamity from God terrifies me, and His splendor I cannot overpower.  
  
###### 24  
If I have put my trust in gold or called pure gold my security,  
  
###### 25  
if I have rejoiced in my great wealth because my hand had gained so much,  
  
###### 26  
if I have beheld the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor,  
  
###### 27  
so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,  
  
###### 28  
this would also be an iniquity to be judged, for I would have denied God on high.  
  
###### 29  
If I have rejoiced in my enemy’s ruin, or exulted when evil befell him—  
  
###### 30  
I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking for his life with a curse—  
  
###### 31  
if the men of my house have not said, ‘Who is there who has not had his fill?’—  
  
###### 32  
but no stranger had to lodge on the street, for my door has been open to the traveler—  
  
###### 33  
if I have covered my transgressions like Adam by hiding my guilt in my heart,  
  
###### 34  
because I greatly feared the crowds and the contempt of the clans terrified me, so that I kept silent and would not go outside—  
  
###### 35  
(Oh, that I had one to hear me! Here is my signature. Let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser compose an indictment.  
  
###### 36  
Surely I would carry it on my shoulder and wear it like a crown.  
  
###### 37  
I would give account of all my steps; I would approach Him like a prince.)—  
  
###### 38  
if my land cries out against me and its furrows weep together,  
  
###### 39  
if I have devoured its produce without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants,  
  
###### 40  
then let briers grow instead of wheat and stinkweed instead of barley.” Thus conclude the words of Job.
