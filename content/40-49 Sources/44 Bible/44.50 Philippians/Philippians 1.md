###### 1  
Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons:  
  
###### 2  
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  
  
###### 3  
I thank my God every time I remember you.  
  
###### 4  
In every prayer for all of you, I always pray with joy,  
  
###### 5  
because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,  
  
###### 6  
being confident of this, that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.  
  
###### 7  
It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart. For in my chains and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel, you are all partners in grace with me.  
  
###### 8  
God is my witness how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.  
  
###### 9  
And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight,  
  
###### 10  
so that you may be able to test and prove what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,  
  
###### 11  
filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.  
  
###### 12  
Now I want you to know, brothers, that my circumstances have actually served to advance the gospel.  
  
###### 13  
As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.  
  
###### 14  
And most of the brothers, confident in the Lord by my chains, now dare more greatly to speak the word without fear.  
  
###### 15  
It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.  
  
###### 16  
The latter do so in love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel.  
  
###### 17  
The former, however, preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can add to the distress of my chains.  
  
###### 18  
What then is the issue? Just this: that in every way, whether by false motives or true, Christ is preached. And in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,  
  
###### 19  
because I know that through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, my distress will turn out for my deliverance.  
  
###### 20  
I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have complete boldness so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.  
  
###### 21  
For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.  
  
###### 22  
But if I go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. So what shall I choose? I do not know.  
  
###### 23  
I am torn between the two. I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better indeed.  
  
###### 24  
But it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.  
  
###### 25  
Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,  
  
###### 26  
so that through my coming to you again your exultation in Christ Jesus will resound on account of me.  
  
###### 27  
Nevertheless, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending side by side for the faith of the gospel,  
  
###### 28  
without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a clear sign of their destruction but of your salvation, and it is from God.  
  
###### 29  
For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for Him,  
  
###### 30  
since you are encountering the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.
