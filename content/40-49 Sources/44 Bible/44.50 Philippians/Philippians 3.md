###### 1  
Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you.  
  
###### 2  
Watch out for those dogs, those workers of evil, those mutilators of the flesh!  
  
###### 3  
For it is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh—  
  
###### 4  
though I myself could have such confidence. If anyone else thinks he has grounds for confidence in the flesh, I have more:  
  
###### 5  
circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin; a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee;  
  
###### 6  
as to zeal, persecuting the church; as to righteousness in the law, faultless.  
  
###### 7  
But whatever was gain to me I count as loss for the sake of Christ.  
  
###### 8  
More than that, I count all things as loss compared to the surpassing excellence of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ  
  
###### 9  
and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God on the basis of faith.  
  
###### 10  
I want to know Christ and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to Him in His death,  
  
###### 11  
and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead.  
  
###### 12  
Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.  
  
###### 13  
Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,  
  
###### 14  
I press on toward the goal to win the prize of God’s heavenly calling in Christ Jesus.  
  
###### 15  
All of us who are mature should embrace this point of view. And if you think differently about some issue, God will reveal this to you as well.  
  
###### 16  
Nevertheless, we must live up to what we have already attained.  
  
###### 17  
Join one another in following my example, brothers, and carefully observe those who walk according to the pattern we set for you.  
  
###### 18  
For as I have often told you before, and now say again even with tears: Many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.  
  
###### 19  
Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and their glory is in their shame. Their minds are set on earthly things.  
  
###### 20  
But our citizenship is in heaven, and we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,  
  
###### 21  
who, by the power that enables Him to subject all things to Himself, will transform our lowly bodies to be like His glorious body.
