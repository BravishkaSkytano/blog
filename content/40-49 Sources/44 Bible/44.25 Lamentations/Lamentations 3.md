###### 1  
I am the man who has seen affliction under the rod of God’s wrath.  
  
###### 2  
He has driven me away and made me walk in darkness instead of light.  
  
###### 3  
Indeed, He keeps turning His hand against me all day long.  
  
###### 4  
He has worn away my flesh and skin; He has shattered my bones.  
  
###### 5  
He has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.  
  
###### 6  
He has made me dwell in darkness like those dead for ages.  
  
###### 7  
He has walled me in so I cannot escape; He has weighed me down with chains.  
  
###### 8  
Even when I cry out and plead for help, He shuts out my prayer.  
  
###### 9  
He has barred my ways with cut stones; He has made my paths crooked.  
  
###### 10  
He is a bear lying in wait, a lion hiding in ambush.  
  
###### 11  
He forced me off my path and tore me to pieces; He left me without help.  
  
###### 12  
He bent His bow and set me as the target for His arrow.  
  
###### 13  
He pierced my kidneys with His arrows.  
  
###### 14  
I am a laughingstock to all my people; they mock me in song all day long.  
  
###### 15  
He has filled me with bitterness; He has intoxicated me with wormwood.  
  
###### 16  
He has ground my teeth with gravel and trampled me in the dust.  
  
###### 17  
My soul has been deprived of peace; I have forgotten what prosperity is.  
  
###### 18  
So I say, “My strength has perished, along with my hope from the LORD.”  
  
###### 19  
Remember my affliction and wandering, the wormwood and the gall.  
  
###### 20  
Surely my soul remembers and is humbled within me.  
  
###### 21  
Yet I call this to mind, and therefore I have hope:  
  
###### 22  
Because of the loving devotion of the LORD we are not consumed, for His mercies never fail.  
  
###### 23  
They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness!  
  
###### 24  
“The LORD is my portion,” says my soul, “therefore I will hope in Him.”  
  
###### 25  
The LORD is good to those who wait for Him, to the soul who seeks Him.  
  
###### 26  
It is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.  
  
###### 27  
It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is still young.  
  
###### 28  
Let him sit alone in silence, for God has disciplined him.  
  
###### 29  
Let him bury his face in the dust—perhaps there is still hope.  
  
###### 30  
Let him offer his cheek to the one who would strike him; let him be filled with reproach.  
  
###### 31  
For the Lord will not cast us off forever.  
  
###### 32  
Even if He causes grief, He will show compassion according to His abundant loving devotion.  
  
###### 33  
For He does not willingly afflict or grieve the sons of men.  
  
###### 34  
To crush underfoot all the prisoners of the land,  
  
###### 35  
to deny a man justice before the Most High,  
  
###### 36  
to subvert a man in his lawsuit—of these the Lord does not approve.  
  
###### 37  
Who has spoken and it came to pass, unless the Lord has ordained it?  
  
###### 38  
Do not both adversity and good come from the mouth of the Most High?  
  
###### 39  
Why should any mortal man complain, in view of his sins?  
  
###### 40  
Let us examine and test our ways, and turn back to the LORD.  
  
###### 41  
Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven:  
  
###### 42  
“We have sinned and rebelled; You have not forgiven.”  
  
###### 43  
You have covered Yourself in anger and pursued us; You have killed without pity.  
  
###### 44  
You have covered Yourself with a cloud that no prayer can pass through.  
  
###### 45  
You have made us scum and refuse among the nations.  
  
###### 46  
All our enemies open their mouths against us.  
  
###### 47  
Panic and pitfall have come upon us—devastation and destruction.  
  
###### 48  
Streams of tears flow from my eyes over the destruction of the daughter of my people.  
  
###### 49  
My eyes overflow unceasingly, without relief,  
  
###### 50  
until the LORD looks down from heaven and sees.  
  
###### 51  
My eyes bring grief to my soul because of all the daughters of my city.  
  
###### 52  
Without cause my enemies hunted me like a bird.  
  
###### 53  
They dropped me alive into a pit and cast stones upon me.  
  
###### 54  
The waters flowed over my head, and I thought I was going to die.  
  
###### 55  
I called on Your name, O LORD, out of the depths of the Pit.  
  
###### 56  
You heard my plea: “Do not ignore my cry for relief.”  
  
###### 57  
You drew near when I called on You; You said, “Do not be afraid.”  
  
###### 58  
You defend my cause, O Lord; You redeem my life.  
  
###### 59  
You have seen, O LORD, the wrong done to me; vindicate my cause!  
  
###### 60  
You have seen all their malice, all their plots against me.  
  
###### 61  
O LORD, You have heard their insults, all their plots against me—  
  
###### 62  
the slander and murmuring of my assailants against me all day long.  
  
###### 63  
When they sit and when they rise, see how they mock me in song.  
  
###### 64  
You will pay them back what they deserve, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.  
  
###### 65  
Put a veil of anguish over their hearts; may Your curse be upon them!  
  
###### 66  
You will pursue them in anger and exterminate them from under Your heavens, O LORD.
