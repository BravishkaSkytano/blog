###### 1  
Remember, O LORD, what has happened to us. Look and see our disgrace!  
  
###### 2  
Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our houses to foreigners.  
  
###### 3  
We have become fatherless orphans; our mothers are widows.  
  
###### 4  
We must buy the water we drink; our wood comes at a price.  
  
###### 5  
We are closely pursued; we are weary and find no rest.  
  
###### 6  
We submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread.  
  
###### 7  
Our fathers sinned and are no more, but we bear their punishment.  
  
###### 8  
Slaves rule over us; there is no one to deliver us from their hands.  
  
###### 9  
We get our bread at the risk of our lives because of the sword in the wilderness.  
  
###### 10  
Our skin is as hot as an oven with fever from our hunger.  
  
###### 11  
Women have been ravished in Zion, virgins in the cities of Judah.  
  
###### 12  
Princes have been hung up by their hands; elders receive no respect.  
  
###### 13  
Young men toil at millstones; boys stagger under loads of wood.  
  
###### 14  
The elders have left the city gate; the young men have stopped their music.  
  
###### 15  
Joy has left our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning.  
  
###### 16  
The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned!  
  
###### 17  
Because of this, our hearts are faint; because of these, our eyes grow dim—  
  
###### 18  
because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate, patrolled by foxes.  
  
###### 19  
You, O LORD, reign forever; Your throne endures from generation to generation.  
  
###### 20  
Why have You forgotten us forever? Why have You forsaken us for so long?  
  
###### 21  
Restore us to Yourself, O LORD, so we may return; renew our days as of old,  
  
###### 22  
unless You have utterly rejected us and remain angry with us beyond measure.
