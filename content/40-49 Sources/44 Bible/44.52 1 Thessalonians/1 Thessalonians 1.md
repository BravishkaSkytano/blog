###### 1  
Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace and peace to you.  
  
###### 2  
We always thank God for all of you, remembering you in our prayers  
  
###### 3  
and continually recalling before our God and Father your work of faith, your labor of love, and your enduring hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.  
  
###### 4  
Brothers who are beloved by God, we know that He has chosen you,  
  
###### 5  
because our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power, in the Holy Spirit, and with great conviction—just as you know we lived among you for your sake.  
  
###### 6  
And you became imitators of us and of the Lord when you welcomed the message with the joy of the Holy Spirit, in spite of your great suffering.  
  
###### 7  
As a result, you have become an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.  
  
###### 8  
For not only did the message of the Lord ring out from you to Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone out to every place, so that we have no need to say anything more.  
  
###### 9  
For they themselves report what kind of welcome you gave us, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God  
  
###### 10  
and to await His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead—Jesus our deliverer from the coming wrath.
