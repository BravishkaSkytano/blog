###### 1  
Now about the times and seasons, brothers, we do not need to write to you.  
  
###### 2  
For you are fully aware that the Day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.  
  
###### 3  
While people are saying, “Peace and security,” destruction will come upon them suddenly, like labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.  
  
###### 4  
But you, brothers, are not in the darkness so that this day should overtake you like a thief.  
  
###### 5  
For you are all sons of the light and sons of the day; we do not belong to the night or to the darkness.  
  
###### 6  
So then, let us not sleep as the others do, but let us remain awake and sober.  
  
###### 7  
For those who sleep, sleep at night; and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.  
  
###### 8  
But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and the helmet of our hope of salvation.  
  
###### 9  
For God has not appointed us to suffer wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  
  
###### 10  
He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with Him.  
  
###### 11  
Therefore encourage and build one another up, just as you are already doing.  
  
###### 12  
But we ask you, brothers, to acknowledge those who work diligently among you, who preside over you in the Lord and give you instruction.  
  
###### 13  
In love, hold them in highest regard because of their work. Live in peace with one another.  
  
###### 14  
And we urge you, brothers, to admonish the unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, and be patient with everyone.  
  
###### 15  
Make sure that no one repays evil for evil. Always pursue what is good for one another and for all people.  
  
###### 16  
Rejoice at all times.  
  
###### 17  
Pray without ceasing.  
  
###### 18  
Give thanks in every circumstance, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.  
  
###### 19  
Do not extinguish the Spirit.  
  
###### 20  
Do not treat prophecies with contempt,  
  
###### 21  
but test all things. Hold fast to what is good.  
  
###### 22  
Abstain from every form of evil.  
  
###### 23  
Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely, and may your entire spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
  
###### 24  
The One who calls you is faithful, and He will do it.  
  
###### 25  
Brothers, pray for us as well.  
  
###### 26  
Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.  
  
###### 27  
I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.  
  
###### 28  
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
