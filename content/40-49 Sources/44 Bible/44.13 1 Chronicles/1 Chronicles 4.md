and they journeyed to the entrance of Gedor, to the east side of the valley, in search of pasture for their flocks.  
  
###### 40  
There they found rich, good pasture, and the land was spacious, peaceful, and quiet; for some Hamites had lived there formerly.  
  
###### 41  
These who were noted by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. They attacked the Hamites and Meunites there in their dwellings, devoting them to destruction even to this day. Then they settled in their place, because there was pasture for their flocks.

And five hundred of these Simeonites led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi, went to Mount Seir
