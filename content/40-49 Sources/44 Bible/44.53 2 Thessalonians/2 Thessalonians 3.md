###### 1  
Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may spread quickly and be held in honor, just as it was with you.  
  
###### 2  
And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men; for not everyone holds to the faith.  
  
###### 3  
But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one.  
  
###### 4  
And we have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do what we command.  
  
###### 5  
May the Lord direct your hearts into God’s love and Christ’s perseverance.  
  
###### 6  
Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from any brother who leads an undisciplined life that is not in keeping with the tradition you received from us.  
  
###### 7  
For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not undisciplined among you,  
  
###### 8  
nor did we eat anyone’s food without paying for it. Instead, in labor and toil, we worked night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you.  
  
###### 9  
Not that we lack this right, but we wanted to offer ourselves as an example for you to imitate.  
  
###### 10  
For even while we were with you, we gave you this command: “If anyone is unwilling to work, he shall not eat.”  
  
###### 11  
Yet we hear that some of you are leading undisciplined lives and accomplishing nothing but being busybodies.  
  
###### 12  
We command and urge such people by our Lord Jesus Christ to begin working quietly to earn their own living.  
  
###### 13  
But as for you, brothers, do not grow weary in well-doing.  
  
###### 14  
Take note of anyone who does not obey the instructions we have given in this letter. Do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.  
  
###### 15  
Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.  
  
###### 16  
Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.  
  
###### 17  
This greeting is in my own hand—Paul. This is my mark in every letter; it is the way I write.  
  
###### 18  
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you.
