###### 1  
Woe is me! For I am like one gathering summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard; there is no cluster to eat, no early fig that I crave.  
  
###### 2  
The godly man has perished from the earth; there is no one upright among men. They all lie in wait for blood; they hunt one another with a net.  
  
###### 3  
Both hands are skilled at evil; the prince and the judge demand a bribe. When the powerful utters his evil desire, they all conspire together.  
  
###### 4  
The best of them is like a brier; the most upright is sharper than a hedge of thorns. The day for your watchmen has come, the day of your visitation. Now is the time of their confusion.  
  
###### 5  
Do not rely on a friend; do not trust in a companion. Seal the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your arms.  
  
###### 6  
For a son dishonors his father, a daughter rises against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. A man’s enemies are the members of his own household.  
  
###### 7  
But as for me, I will look to the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me.  
  
###### 8  
Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will arise; though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light.  
  
###### 9  
Because I have sinned against Him, I must endure the rage of the LORD, until He argues my case and executes justice for me. He will bring me into the light; I will see His righteousness.  
  
###### 10  
Then my enemy will see and will be covered with shame—she who said to me, “Where is the LORD your God?” My eyes will see her; at that time she will be trampled like mud in the streets.  
  
###### 11  
The day for rebuilding your walls will come—the day for extending your boundary.  
  
###### 12  
On that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, even from Egypt to the Euphrates, from sea to sea and mountain to mountain.  
  
###### 13  
Then the earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants, as the fruit of their deeds.  
  
###### 14  
Shepherd with Your staff Your people, the flock of Your inheritance. They live alone in a woodland, surrounded by pastures. Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.  
  
###### 15  
As in the days when you came out of Egypt, I will show My wonders.  
  
###### 16  
Nations will see and be ashamed, deprived of all their might. They will put their hands over their mouths, and their ears will become deaf.  
  
###### 17  
They will lick the dust like a snake, like reptiles slithering on the ground. They will crawl from their holes in the presence of the LORD our God; they will tremble in fear of You.  
  
###### 18  
Who is a God like You, who pardons iniquity and passes over the transgression of the remnant of His inheritance—who does not retain His anger forever, because He delights in loving devotion?  
  
###### 19  
He will again have compassion on us; He will vanquish our iniquities. You will cast out all our sins into the depths of the sea.  
  
###### 20  
You will show faithfulness to Jacob and loving devotion to Abraham, as You swore to our fathers from the days of old.
