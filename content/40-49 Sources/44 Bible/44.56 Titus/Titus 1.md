###### 1  
Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness,  
  
###### 2  
in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began.  
  
###### 3  
In His own time He has made His word evident in the proclamation entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior.  
  
###### 4  
To Titus, my true child in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.  
  
###### 5  
The reason I left you in Crete was that you would set in order what was unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.  
  
###### 6  
An elder must be blameless, the husband of but one wife, having children who are believers and who are not open to accusation of indiscretion or insubordination.  
  
###### 7  
As God’s steward, an overseer must be above reproach—not self-absorbed, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not greedy for money.  
  
###### 8  
Instead, he must be hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined.  
  
###### 9  
He must hold firmly to the faithful word as it was taught, so that he can encourage others by sound teaching and refute those who contradict it.  
  
###### 10  
For many are rebellious and full of empty talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision,  
  
###### 11  
who must be silenced. For the sake of dishonorable gain, they undermine entire households and teach things they should not.  
  
###### 12  
As one of their own prophets has said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”  
  
###### 13  
This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sternly, so that they will be sound in the faith  
  
###### 14  
and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of men who have rejected the truth.  
  
###### 15  
To the pure, all things are pure; but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure. Indeed, both their minds and their consciences are defiled.  
  
###### 16  
They profess to know God, but by their actions they deny Him. They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good deed.
