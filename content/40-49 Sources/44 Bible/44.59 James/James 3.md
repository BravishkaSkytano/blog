###### 1  
Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.  
  
###### 2  
We all stumble in many ways. If anyone is never at fault in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to control his whole body.  
  
###### 3  
When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can guide the whole animal.  
  
###### 4  
Consider ships as well. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot is inclined.  
  
###### 5  
In the same way, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it boasts of great things. Consider how small a spark sets a great forest ablaze.  
  
###### 6  
The tongue also is a fire, a world of wickedness among the parts of the body. It pollutes the whole person, sets the course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.  
  
###### 7  
All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by man,  
  
###### 8  
but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.  
  
###### 9  
With the tongue we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God’s likeness.  
  
###### 10  
Out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, this should not be!  
  
###### 11  
Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring?  
  
###### 12  
My brothers, can a fig tree grow olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.  
  
###### 13  
Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show it by his good conduct, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.  
  
###### 14  
But if you harbor bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast in it or deny the truth.  
  
###### 15  
Such wisdom does not come from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.  
  
###### 16  
For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every evil practice.  
  
###### 17  
But the wisdom from above is first of all pure, then peace-loving, gentle, accommodating, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial, and sincere.  
  
###### 18  
Peacemakers who sow in peace reap the fruit of righteousness.
