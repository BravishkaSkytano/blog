###### 1  
What causes conflicts and quarrels among you? Don’t they come from the passions at war within you?  
  
###### 2  
You crave what you do not have; you kill and covet, but are unable to obtain it. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask.  
  
###### 3  
And when you do ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may squander it on your pleasures.  
  
###### 4  
You adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore, whoever chooses to be a friend of the world renders himself an enemy of God.  
  
###### 5  
Or do you think the Scripture says without reason that the Spirit He caused to dwell in us yearns with envy?  
  
###### 6  
But He gives us more grace. This is why it says: “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”  
  
###### 7  
Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.  
  
###### 8  
Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.  
  
###### 9  
Grieve, mourn, and weep. Turn your laughter to mourning, and your joy to gloom.  
  
###### 10  
Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you.  
  
###### 11  
Brothers, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against his brother or judges him speaks against the law and judges it. And if you judge the law, you are not a practitioner of the law, but a judge of it.  
  
###### 12  
There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?  
  
###### 13  
Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business, and make a profit.”  
  
###### 14  
You do not even know what will happen tomorrow! What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.  
  
###### 15  
Instead, you ought to say, “If the Lord is willing, we will live and do this or that.”  
  
###### 16  
As it is, you boast in your proud intentions. All such boasting is evil.  
  
###### 17  
Anyone, then, who knows the right thing to do, yet fails to do it, is guilty of sin.
