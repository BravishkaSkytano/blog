###### 1  
My brothers, as you hold out your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, do not show favoritism.  
  
###### 2  
Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in.  
  
###### 3  
If you lavish attention on the man in fine clothes and say, “Here is a seat of honor,” but say to the poor man, “You must stand” or “Sit at my feet,”  
  
###### 4  
have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?  
  
###### 5  
Listen, my beloved brothers: Has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom He promised those who love Him?  
  
###### 6  
But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who oppress you and drag you into court?  
  
###### 7  
Are they not the ones who blaspheme the noble name by which you have been called?  
  
###### 8  
If you really fulfill the royal law stated in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well.  
  
###### 9  
But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.  
  
###### 10  
Whoever keeps the whole law but stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.  
  
###### 11  
For He who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” If you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.  
  
###### 12  
Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom.  
  
###### 13  
For judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment.  
  
###### 14  
What good is it, my brothers, if someone claims to have faith, but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?  
  
###### 15  
Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.  
  
###### 16  
If one of you tells him, “Go in peace; stay warm and well fed,” but does not provide for his physical needs, what good is that?  
  
###### 17  
So too, faith by itself, if it does not result in action, is dead.  
  
###### 18  
But someone will say, “You have faith and I have deeds.” Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.  
  
###### 19  
You believe that God is one. Good for you! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.  
  
###### 20  
O foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is worthless?  
  
###### 21  
Was not our father Abraham justified by what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?  
  
###### 22  
You see that his faith was working with his actions, and his faith was perfected by what he did.  
  
###### 23  
And the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,” and he was called a friend of God.  
  
###### 24  
As you can see, a man is justified by his deeds and not by faith alone.  
  
###### 25  
In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute justified by her actions when she welcomed the spies and sent them off on another route?  
  
###### 26  
As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.
