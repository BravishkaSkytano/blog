###### 1  
After Saul had returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.”  
  
###### 2  
So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and went to look for David and his men in the region of the Rocks of the Wild Goats.  
  
###### 3  
Soon Saul came to the sheepfolds along the road, where there was a cave, and he went in to relieve himself. And David and his men were hiding in the recesses of the cave.  
  
###### 4  
So David’s men said to him, “This is the day about which the LORD said to you, ‘Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do with him as you wish.’” Then David crept up secretly and cut off a corner of Saul’s robe.  
  
###### 5  
Afterward, David’s conscience was stricken because he had cut off the corner of Saul’s robe.  
  
###### 6  
So he said to his men, “The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the LORD’s anointed. May I never lift my hand against him, since he is the LORD’s anointed.”  
  
###### 7  
With these words David restrained his men, and he did not let them rise up against Saul. Then Saul left the cave and went on his way.  
  
###### 8  
After that, David got up, went out of the cave, and called out to Saul, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed facedown in reverence  
  
###### 9  
and said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘Look, David intends to harm you’?  
  
###### 10  
Behold, this day you have seen with your own eyes that the LORD delivered you into my hand in the cave. I was told to kill you, but I spared you and said, ‘I will not lift my hand against my lord, since he is the LORD’s anointed.’  
  
###### 11  
See, my father, look at the corner of your robe in my hand. For I cut it off, but I did not kill you. See and know that there is no evil or rebellion in my hands. I have not sinned against you, even though you are hunting me down to take my life.  
  
###### 12  
May the LORD judge between you and me, and may the LORD take vengeance on you, but my hand will never be against you.  
  
###### 13  
As the old proverb says, ‘Wickedness proceeds from the wicked.’ But my hand will never be against you.  
  
###### 14  
Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea?  
  
###### 15  
May the LORD be our judge and decide between you and me. May He take notice and plead my case and deliver me from your hand.”  
  
###### 16  
When David had finished saying these things, Saul called back, “Is that your voice, David my son?” Then Saul wept aloud  
  
###### 17  
and said to David, “You are more righteous than I, for you have rewarded me with good, though I have rewarded you with evil.  
  
###### 18  
And you have shown this day how well you have dealt with me; for when the LORD delivered me into your hand, you did not kill me.  
  
###### 19  
When a man finds his enemy, does he let him go away unharmed? May the LORD reward you with good for what you have done for me this day.  
  
###### 20  
Now I know for sure that you will be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands.  
  
###### 21  
So now, swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father’s house.”  
  
###### 22  
So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
