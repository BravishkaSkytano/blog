###### 1  
From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the LORD his God,  
  
###### 2  
saying: “In my distress I called to the LORD, and He answered me. From the belly of Sheol I called for help, and You heard my voice.  
  
###### 3  
For You cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the current swirled about me; all Your breakers and waves swept over me.  
  
###### 4  
At this, I said, ‘I have been banished from Your sight; yet I will look once more toward Your holy temple.’  
  
###### 5  
The waters engulfed me to take my life; the watery depths closed around me; the seaweed wrapped around my head.  
  
###### 6  
To the roots of the mountains I descended; the earth beneath me barred me in forever! But You raised my life from the pit, O LORD my God!  
  
###### 7  
As my life was fading away, I remembered the LORD. My prayer went up to You, to Your holy temple.  
  
###### 8  
Those who cling to worthless idols forsake His loving devotion.  
  
###### 9  
But I, with the voice of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to You. I will fulfill what I have vowed. Salvation is from the LORD!”  
  
###### 10  
And the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
