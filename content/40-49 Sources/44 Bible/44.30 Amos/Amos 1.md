So I will send fire upon the house of Hazael to consume the citadels of Ben-hadad.  
  
###### 5  
I will break down the gates of Damascus; I will cut off the ruler of the Valley of Aven and the one who wields the scepter in Beth-eden. The people of Aram will be exiled to Kir,” says the LORD.  
  
###### 6  
This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Gaza, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they exiled a whole population, delivering them up to Edom.  
  
###### 7  
So I will send fire upon the walls of Gaza, to consume its citadels.  
  
###### 8

###### 12  
So I will send fire upon Teman to consume the citadels of Bozrah.”  
  
###### 13  
This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of the Ammonites, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead in order to enlarge their territory.  
  
###### 14  
So I will kindle a fire in the walls of Rabbah to consume its citadels amid war cries on the day of battle and a violent wind on the day of tempest.

Their king will go into exile—he and his princes together,” says the LORD.
