###### 1  
This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Moab, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because he burned to lime the bones of Edom’s king.  
  
###### 2  
So I will send fire against Moab to consume the citadels of Kerioth. Moab will die in tumult, amid war cries and the sound of the ram’s horn.  
  
###### 3  
I will cut off the ruler of Moab and kill all the officials with him,” says the LORD.  
  
###### 4  
This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Judah, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they reject the Law of the LORD and fail to keep His statutes; they are led astray by the lies in which their fathers walked.  
  
###### 5  
So I will send fire upon Judah to consume the citadels of Jerusalem.”  
  
###### 6  
This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Israel, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they sell the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals.  
  
###### 7  
They trample on the heads of the poor as on the dust of the earth; they push the needy out of their way. A man and his father have relations with the same girl and so profane My holy name.  
  
###### 8  
They lie down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge. And in the house of their God, they drink wine obtained through fines.  
  
###### 9  
Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them, though his height was like that of the cedars, and he was as strong as the oaks. Yet I destroyed his fruit above and his roots below.  
  
###### 10  
And I brought you up from the land of Egypt and led you forty years in the wilderness, that you might take possession of the land of the Amorite.  
  
###### 11  
I raised up prophets from your sons and Nazirites from your young men. Is this not true, O children of Israel?” declares the LORD.  
  
###### 12  
“But you made the Nazirites drink wine and commanded the prophets not to prophesy.  
  
###### 13  
Behold, I am about to crush you in your place as with a cart full of grain.  
  
###### 14  
Escape will fail the swift, the strong will not prevail by his strength, and the mighty will not save his life.  
  
###### 15  
The archer will not stand his ground, the fleet of foot will not escape, and the horseman will not save his life.  
  
###### 16  
Even the bravest of mighty men will flee naked on that day,” declares the LORD.
