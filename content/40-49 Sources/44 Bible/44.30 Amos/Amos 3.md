###### 1  
Hear this word that the LORD has spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family that I brought up out of the land of Egypt:  
  
###### 2  
“Only you have I known from all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.”  
  
###### 3  
Can two walk together without agreeing where to go?  
  
###### 4  
Does a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey? Does a young lion growl in his den if he has caught nothing?  
  
###### 5  
Does a bird land in a snare where no bait has been set? Does a trap spring from the ground when it has nothing to catch?  
  
###### 6  
If a ram’s horn sounds in a city, do the people not tremble? If calamity comes to a city, has not the LORD caused it?  
  
###### 7  
Surely the Lord GOD does nothing without revealing His plan to His servants the prophets.  
  
###### 8  
The lion has roared—who will not fear? The Lord GOD has spoken—who will not prophesy?  
  
###### 9  
Proclaim to the citadels of Ashdod and to the citadels of Egypt: “Assemble on the mountains of Samaria; see the great unrest in the city and the acts of oppression in her midst.”  
  
###### 10  
“For they know not how to do right,” declares the LORD. “They store up violence and destruction in their citadels.”  
  
###### 11  
Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: “An enemy will surround the land; he will pull down your strongholds and plunder your citadels.”  
  
###### 12  
This is what the LORD says: “As the shepherd snatches from the mouth of the lion two legs or a piece of an ear, so the Israelites dwelling in Samaria will be rescued having just the corner of a bed or the cushion of a couch.  
  
###### 13  
Hear and testify against the house of Jacob, declares the Lord GOD, the God of Hosts.  
  
###### 14  
On the day I punish Israel for their transgressions, I will visit destruction on the altars of Bethel; the horns of the altar will be cut off, and they will fall to the ground.  
  
###### 15  
I will tear down the winter house along with the summer house; the houses of ivory will also perish, and the great houses will come to an end,” declares the LORD.
