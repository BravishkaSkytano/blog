###### 1  
As God’s fellow workers, then, we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain.  
  
###### 2  
For He says: “In the time of favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.” Behold, now is the time of favor; now is the day of salvation!  
  
###### 3  
We put no obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no one can discredit our ministry.  
  
###### 4  
Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships, and calamities;  
  
###### 5  
in beatings, imprisonments, and riots; in labor, sleepless nights, and hunger;  
  
###### 6  
in purity, knowledge, patience, and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love;  
  
###### 7  
in truthful speech and in the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;  
  
###### 8  
through glory and dishonor, slander and praise; viewed as imposters, yet genuine;  
  
###### 9  
as unknown, yet well-known; dying, and yet we live on; punished, yet not killed;  
  
###### 10  
sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.  
  
###### 11  
We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians. Our hearts are open wide.  
  
###### 12  
It is not our affection, but yours, that is restrained.  
  
###### 13  
As a fair exchange, I ask you as my children: Open wide your hearts also.  
  
###### 14  
Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership can righteousness have with wickedness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?  
  
###### 15  
What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?  
  
###### 16  
What agreement can exist between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will dwell with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be My people.”  
  
###### 17  
“Therefore come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you.”  
  
###### 18  
And: “I will be a Father to you, and you will be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.”
