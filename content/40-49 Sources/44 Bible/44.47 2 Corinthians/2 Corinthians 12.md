###### 1  
I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to gain, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.  
  
###### 2  
I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of it I do not know, but God knows.  
  
###### 3  
And I know that this man—whether in the body or out of it I do not know, but God knows—  
  
###### 4  
was caught up to Paradise. The things he heard were too sacred for words, things that man is not permitted to tell.  
  
###### 5  
I will boast about such a man, but I will not boast about myself, except in my weaknesses.  
  
###### 6  
Even if I wanted to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will credit me with more than he sees in me or hears from me,  
  
###### 7  
or because of these surpassingly great revelations. So to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.  
  
###### 8  
Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.  
  
###### 9  
But He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly in my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest on me.  
  
###### 10  
That is why, for the sake of Christ, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.  
  
###### 11  
I have become a fool, but you drove me to it. In fact, you should have commended me, since I am in no way inferior to those “super-apostles,” even though I am nothing.  
  
###### 12  
The true marks of an apostle—signs, wonders, and miracles—were performed among you with great perseverance.  
  
###### 13  
In what way were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!  
  
###### 14  
See, I am ready to come to you a third time, and I will not be a burden, because I am not seeking your possessions, but you. For children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.  
  
###### 15  
And for the sake of your souls, I will most gladly spend my money and myself. If I love you more, will you love me less?  
  
###### 16  
Be that as it may, I was not a burden to you; but crafty as I am, I caught you by trickery.  
  
###### 17  
Did I exploit you by anyone I sent you?  
  
###### 18  
I urged Titus to visit you, and I sent our brother with him. Did Titus exploit you in any way? Did we not walk in the same Spirit and follow in the same footsteps?  
  
###### 19  
Have you been thinking all along that we were making a defense to you? We speak before God in Christ, and all of this, beloved, is to build you up.  
  
###### 20  
For I am afraid that when I come, I may not find you as I wish, and you may not find me as you wish. I fear that there may be quarreling, jealousy, rage, rivalry, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorder.  
  
###### 21  
I am afraid that when I come again, my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of their acts of impurity, sexual immorality, and debauchery.
