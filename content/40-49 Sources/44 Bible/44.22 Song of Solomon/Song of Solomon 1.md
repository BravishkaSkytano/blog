###### 1  
This is Solomon’s Song of Songs.  
  
###### 2  
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is more delightful than wine.  
  
###### 3  
The fragrance of your perfume is pleasing; your name is like perfume poured out. No wonder the maidens adore you.  
  
###### 4  
Take me away with you—let us hurry! May the king bring me to his chambers. We will rejoice and delight in you; we will praise your love more than wine. It is only right that they adore you.  
  
###### 5  
I am dark, yet lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.  
  
###### 6  
Do not stare because I am dark, for the sun has gazed upon me. My mother’s sons were angry with me; they made me a keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have neglected.  
  
###### 7  
Tell me, O one I love, where do you pasture your sheep? Where do you rest them at midday? Why should I be like a veiled woman beside the flocks of your companions?  
  
###### 8  
If you do not know, O fairest of women, follow the tracks of the flock, and graze your young goats near the tents of the shepherds.  
  
###### 9  
I compare you, my darling, to a mare among Pharaoh’s chariots.  
  
###### 10  
Your cheeks are beautiful with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels.  
  
###### 11  
We will make you ornaments of gold, studded with beads of silver.  
  
###### 12  
While the king was at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance.  
  
###### 13  
My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh resting between my breasts.  
  
###### 14  
My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of En-gedi.  
  
###### 15  
How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how very beautiful! Your eyes are like doves.  
  
###### 16  
How handsome you are, my beloved! Oh, how delightful! The soft grass is our bed.  
  
###### 17  
The beams of our house are cedars; our rafters are fragrant firs.
