###### 1  
Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Which way has he turned? We will seek him with you.  
  
###### 2  
My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to pasture his flock in the gardens and to gather lilies.  
  
###### 3  
I belong to my beloved and he belongs to me; he pastures his flock among the lilies.  
  
###### 4  
You are as beautiful, my darling, as Tirzah, as lovely as Jerusalem, as majestic as troops with banners.  
  
###### 5  
Turn your eyes away from me, for they have overcome me. Your hair is like a flock of goats streaming down from Gilead.  
  
###### 6  
Your teeth are like a flock of sheep coming up from the washing; each has its twin, and not one of them is lost.  
  
###### 7  
Your brow behind your veil is like a slice of pomegranate.  
  
###### 8  
There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and maidens without number,  
  
###### 9  
but my dove, my perfect one, is unique, the favorite of the mother who bore her. The maidens see her and call her blessed; the queens and concubines sing her praises.  
  
###### 10  
Who is this who shines like the dawn, as fair as the moon, as bright as the sun, as majestic as the stars in procession?  
  
###### 11  
I went down to the walnut grove to see the blossoms of the valley, to see if the vines were budding or the pomegranates were in bloom.  
  
###### 12  
Before I realized it, my desire had set me among the royal chariots of my people.  
  
###### 13  
Come back, come back, O Shulammite! Come back, come back, that we may gaze upon you. Why do you look at the Shulammite, as on the dance of Mahanaim?
