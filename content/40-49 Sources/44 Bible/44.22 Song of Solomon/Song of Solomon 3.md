###### 1  
On my bed at night I sought the one I love; I sought him, but did not find him.  
  
###### 2  
I will arise now and go about the city, through the streets and squares. I will seek the one I love. So I sought him but did not find him.  
  
###### 3  
I encountered the watchmen on their rounds of the city: “Have you seen the one I love?”  
  
###### 4  
I had just passed them when I found the one I love. I held him and would not let go until I had brought him to my mother’s house, to the chamber of the one who conceived me.  
  
###### 5  
O daughters of Jerusalem, I adjure you by the gazelles and does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until the time is right.  
  
###### 6  
Who is this coming up from the wilderness like a column of smoke, scented with myrrh and frankincense from all the spices of the merchant?  
  
###### 7  
Behold, it is Solomon’s carriage, escorted by sixty of the mightiest men of Israel.  
  
###### 8  
All are skilled with the sword, experienced in warfare. Each has his sword at his side prepared for the terror of the night.  
  
###### 9  
King Solomon has made his carriage out of the timber of Lebanon.  
  
###### 10  
He has made its posts of silver, its base of gold, its seat of purple fabric. Its interior is inlaid with love by the daughters of Jerusalem.  
  
###### 11  
Come out, O daughters of Zion, and gaze at King Solomon, wearing the crown his mother bestowed on the day of his wedding—the day of his heart’s rejoicing.
