###### 1  
I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valley.  
  
###### 2  
Like a lily among the thorns is my darling among the maidens.  
  
###### 3  
Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest is my beloved among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste.  
  
###### 4  
He has brought me to the house of wine, and his banner over me is love.  
  
###### 5  
Sustain me with raisins; refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love.  
  
###### 6  
His left hand is under my head, and his right arm embraces me.  
  
###### 7  
O daughters of Jerusalem, I adjure you by the gazelles and does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until the time is right.  
  
###### 8  
Listen! My beloved approaches. Look! Here he comes, leaping across the mountains, bounding over the hills.  
  
###### 9  
My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look, he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice.  
  
###### 10  
My beloved calls to me, “Arise, my darling. Come away with me, my beautiful one.  
  
###### 11  
For now the winter is past; the rain is over and gone.  
  
###### 12  
The flowers have appeared in the countryside; the season of singing has come, and the cooing of turtledoves is heard in our land.  
  
###### 13  
The fig tree ripens its figs; the blossoming vines spread their fragrance. Arise, come away, my darling; come away with me, my beautiful one.”  
  
###### 14  
O my dove in the clefts of the rock, in the crevices of the cliff, let me see your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your countenance is lovely.  
  
###### 15  
Catch for us the foxes—the little foxes that ruin the vineyards—for our vineyards are in bloom.  
  
###### 16  
My beloved is mine and I am his; he pastures his flock among the lilies.  
  
###### 17  
Before the day breaks and shadows flee, turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of Bether.
