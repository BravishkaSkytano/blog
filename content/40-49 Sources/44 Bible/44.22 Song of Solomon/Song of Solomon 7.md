###### 1  
How beautiful are your sandaled feet, O daughter of the prince! The curves of your thighs are like jewels, the handiwork of a master.  
  
###### 2  
Your navel is a rounded goblet; it never lacks blended wine. Your waist is a mound of wheat encircled by the lilies.  
  
###### 3  
Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.  
  
###### 4  
Your neck is like a tower made of ivory; your eyes are like the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim; your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, facing toward Damascus.  
  
###### 5  
Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel, the hair of your head like purple threads; the king is captured in your tresses.  
  
###### 6  
How fair and pleasant you are, O love, with your delights!  
  
###### 7  
Your stature is like a palm tree; your breasts are clusters of fruit.  
  
###### 8  
I said, “I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit.” May your breasts be like clusters of the vine, the fragrance of your breath like apples,  
  
###### 9  
and your mouth like the finest wine. May it flow smoothly to my beloved, gliding gently over lips and teeth.  
  
###### 10  
I belong to my beloved, and his desire is for me.  
  
###### 11  
Come, my beloved, let us go to the countryside; let us spend the night among the wildflowers.  
  
###### 12  
Let us go early to the vineyards to see if the vine has budded, if the blossom has opened, if the pomegranates are in bloom—there I will give you my love.  
  
###### 13  
The mandrakes send forth a fragrance, and at our door is every delicacy, new as well as old, that I have treasured up for you, my beloved.
