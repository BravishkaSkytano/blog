###### 1  
Then the LORD said to Moses,  
  
###### 2  
“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: I am the LORD your God.  
  
###### 3  
You must not follow the practices of the land of Egypt, where you used to live, and you must not follow the practices of the land of Canaan, into which I am bringing you. You must not walk in their customs.  
  
###### 4  
You are to practice My judgments and keep My statutes by walking in them. I am the LORD your God.  
  
###### 5  
Keep My statutes and My judgments, for the man who does these things will live by them. I am the LORD.  
  
###### 6  
None of you are to approach any close relative to have sexual relations. I am the LORD.  
  
###### 7  
You must not expose the nakedness of your father by having sexual relations with your mother. She is your mother; you must not have sexual relations with her.  
  
###### 8  
You must not have sexual relations with your father’s wife; it would dishonor your father.  
  
###### 9  
You must not have sexual relations with your sister, either your father’s daughter or your mother’s daughter, whether she was born in the same home or elsewhere.  
  
###### 10  
You must not have sexual relations with your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter, for that would shame your family.  
  
###### 11  
You must not have sexual relations with the daughter of your father’s wife, born to your father; she is your sister.  
  
###### 12  
You must not have sexual relations with your father’s sister; she is your father’s close relative.  
  
###### 13  
You must not have sexual relations with your mother’s sister, for she is your mother’s close relative.  
  
###### 14  
You must not dishonor your father’s brother by approaching his wife to have sexual relations with her; she is your aunt.  
  
###### 15  
You must not have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law. She is your son’s wife; you are not to have sexual relations with her.  
  
###### 16  
You must not have sexual relations with your brother’s wife; that would shame your brother.  
  
###### 17  
You must not have sexual relations with both a woman and her daughter. You are not to marry her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter and have sexual relations with her. They are close relatives; it is depraved.  
  
###### 18  
You must not take your wife’s sister as a rival wife and have sexual relations with her while your wife is still alive.  
  
###### 19  
You must not approach a woman to have sexual relations with her during her menstrual period.  
  
###### 20  
You must not lie carnally with your neighbor’s wife and thus defile yourself with her.  
  
###### 21  
You must not give any of your children to be sacrificed to Molech, for you must not profane the name of your God. I am the LORD.  
  
###### 22  
You must not lie with a man as with a woman; that is an abomination.  
  
###### 23  
You must not lie carnally with any animal, thus defiling yourself with it; a woman must not stand before an animal to mate with it; that is a perversion.  
  
###### 24  
Do not defile yourselves by any of these practices, for by all these things the nations I am driving out before you have defiled themselves.  
  
###### 25  
Even the land has become defiled, so I am punishing it for its sin, and the land will vomit out its inhabitants.  
  
###### 26  
But you are to keep My statutes and ordinances, and you must not commit any of these abominations—neither your native-born nor the foreigner who lives among you.  
  
###### 27  
For the men who were in the land before you committed all these abominations, and the land has become defiled.  
  
###### 28  
So if you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it spewed out the nations before you.  
  
###### 29  
Therefore anyone who commits any of these abominations must be cut off from among his people.  
  
###### 30  
You must keep My charge not to practice any of the abominable customs that were practiced before you, so that you do not defile yourselves by them. I am the LORD your God.”
