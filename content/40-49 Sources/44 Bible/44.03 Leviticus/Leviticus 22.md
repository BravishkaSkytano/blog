###### 1  
Then the LORD said to Moses,  
  
###### 2  
“Tell Aaron and his sons to treat with respect the sacred offerings that the Israelites have consecrated to Me, so that they do not profane My holy name. I am the LORD.  
  
###### 3  
Tell them that for the generations to come, if any of their descendants in a state of uncleanness approaches the sacred offerings that the Israelites consecrate to the LORD, that person must be cut off from My presence. I am the LORD.  
  
###### 4  
If a descendant of Aaron has a skin disease or a discharge, he may not eat the sacred offerings until he is clean. Whoever touches anything defiled by a corpse or by a man who has an emission of semen,  
  
###### 5  
or whoever touches a crawling creature or a person that makes him unclean, whatever the uncleanness may be—  
  
###### 6  
the man who touches any of these will remain unclean until evening. He must not eat from the sacred offerings unless he has bathed himself with water.  
  
###### 7  
When the sun has set, he will become clean, and then he may eat from the sacred offerings, for they are his food.  
  
###### 8  
He must not eat anything found dead or torn by wild animals, which would make him unclean. I am the LORD.  
  
###### 9  
The priests must keep My charge, lest they bear the guilt and die because they profane it. I am the LORD who sanctifies them.  
  
###### 10  
No one outside a priest’s family may eat the sacred offering, nor may the guest of a priest or his hired hand eat it.  
  
###### 11  
But if a priest buys a slave with his own money, or if a slave is born in his household, that slave may eat his food.  
  
###### 12  
If the priest’s daughter is married to a man other than a priest, she is not to eat of the sacred contributions.  
  
###### 13  
But if a priest’s daughter with no children becomes widowed or divorced and returns to her father’s house, she may share her father’s food as in her youth. But no outsider may share it.  
  
###### 14  
If anyone eats a sacred offering in error, he must add a fifth to its value and give the sacred offering to the priest.  
  
###### 15  
The priests must not profane the sacred offerings that the Israelites present to the LORD  
  
###### 16  
by allowing the people to eat the sacred offerings and thus to bear the punishment for guilt. For I am the LORD who sanctifies them.”  
  
###### 17  
Then the LORD said to Moses,  
  
###### 18  
“Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites and tell them, ‘Any man of the house of Israel or any foreign resident who presents a gift for a burnt offering to the LORD, whether to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering,  
  
###### 19  
must offer an unblemished male from the cattle, sheep, or goats in order for it to be accepted on your behalf.  
  
###### 20  
You must not present anything with a defect, because it will not be accepted on your behalf.  
  
###### 21  
When a man presents a peace offering to the LORD from the herd or flock to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering, it must be without blemish or defect to be acceptable.  
  
###### 22  
You are not to present to the LORD any animal that is blind, injured, or maimed, or anything with a running sore, a festering rash, or a scab; you must not put any of these on the altar as an offering made by fire to the LORD.  
  
###### 23  
You may present as a freewill offering an ox or sheep that has a deformed or stunted limb, but it is not acceptable in fulfillment of a vow.  
  
###### 24  
You are not to present to the LORD an animal whose testicles are bruised, crushed, torn, or cut; you are not to sacrifice them in your land.  
  
###### 25  
Neither you nor a foreigner shall present food to your God from any such animal. They will not be accepted on your behalf, because they are deformed and flawed.’”  
  
###### 26  
Then the LORD said to Moses,  
  
###### 27  
“When an ox, a sheep, or a goat is born, it must remain with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day on, it will be acceptable as an offering made by fire to the LORD.  
  
###### 28  
But you must not slaughter an ox or a sheep on the same day as its young.  
  
###### 29  
When you sacrifice a thank offering to the LORD, offer it so that it may be acceptable on your behalf.  
  
###### 30  
It must be eaten that same day. Do not leave any of it until morning. I am the LORD.  
  
###### 31  
You are to keep My commandments and practice them. I am the LORD.  
  
###### 32  
You must not profane My holy name. I must be acknowledged as holy among the Israelites. I am the LORD who sanctifies you,  
  
###### 33  
who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the LORD.”
