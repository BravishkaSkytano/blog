###### 1  
Then the LORD said to Moses,  
  
###### 2  
“Command the Israelites to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to keep the lamps burning continually.  
  
###### 3  
Outside the veil of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps continually before the LORD from evening until morning. This is to be a permanent statute for the generations to come.  
  
###### 4  
He shall tend the lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the LORD continually.  
  
###### 5  
You are also to take fine flour and bake twelve loaves, using two-tenths of an ephah for each loaf,  
  
###### 6  
and set them in two rows—six per row—on the table of pure gold before the LORD.  
  
###### 7  
And you are to place pure frankincense near each row, so that it may serve as a memorial portion for the bread, an offering made by fire to the LORD.  
  
###### 8  
Every Sabbath day the bread is to be set out before the LORD on behalf of the Israelites as a permanent covenant.  
  
###### 9  
It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who are to eat it in a holy place; for it is to him a most holy part of the offerings made by fire to the LORD—his portion forever.”  
  
###### 10  
Now the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and a fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite.  
  
###### 11  
The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name with a curse. So they brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)  
  
###### 12  
They placed him in custody until the will of the LORD should be made clear to them.  
  
###### 13  
Then the LORD said to Moses,  
  
###### 14  
“Take the blasphemer outside the camp, and have all who heard him lay their hands on his head; then have the whole assembly stone him.  
  
###### 15  
And you are to tell the Israelites, ‘If anyone curses his God, he shall bear the consequences of his sin.  
  
###### 16  
Whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD must surely be put to death; the whole assembly must surely stone him, whether he is a foreign resident or native; if he blasphemes the Name, he must be put to death.  
  
###### 17  
And if a man takes the life of anyone else, he must surely be put to death.  
  
###### 18  
Whoever kills an animal must make restitution—life for life.  
  
###### 19  
If anyone injures his neighbor, whatever he has done must be done to him:  
  
###### 20  
fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. Just as he injured the other person, the same must be inflicted on him.  
  
###### 21  
Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a man must be put to death.  
  
###### 22  
You are to have the same standard of law for the foreign resident and the native; for I am the LORD your God.’”  
  
###### 23  
Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him. So the Israelites did as the LORD had commanded Moses.
