###### 1  
This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.  
  
###### 2  
As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “Behold, I will send My messenger ahead of You, who will prepare Your way.”  
  
###### 3  
“A voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for Him.’”  
  
###### 4  
John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.  
  
###### 5  
People went out to him from all of Jerusalem and the countryside of Judea. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.  
  
###### 6  
John was clothed in camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.  
  
###### 7  
And he began to proclaim: “After me will come One more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.  
  
###### 8  
I baptize you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”  
  
###### 9  
In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.  
  
###### 10  
As soon as Jesus came up out of the water, He saw the heavens breaking open and the Spirit descending on Him like a dove.  
  
###### 11  
And a voice came from heaven: “You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.”  
  
###### 12  
At once the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness,  
  
###### 13  
and He was there for forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered to Him.  
  
###### 14  
After the arrest of John, Jesus went into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God.  
  
###### 15  
“The time is fulfilled,” He said, “and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe in the gospel!”  
  
###### 16  
As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.  
  
###### 17  
“Come, follow Me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.”  
  
###### 18  
And at once they left their nets and followed Him.  
  
###### 19  
Going on a little farther, He saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat, mending their nets.  
  
###### 20  
Immediately Jesus called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed Him.  
  
###### 21  
Then Jesus and His companions went to Capernaum, and right away Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach.  
  
###### 22  
The people were astonished at His teaching, because He taught as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.  
  
###### 23  
Suddenly a man with an unclean spirit cried out in the synagogue:  
  
###### 24  
“What do You want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”  
  
###### 25  
But Jesus rebuked the spirit. “Be silent!” He said. “Come out of him!”  
  
###### 26  
At this, the unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions and came out with a loud shriek.  
  
###### 27  
All the people were amazed and began to ask one another, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!”  
  
###### 28  
And the news about Jesus spread quickly through the whole region of Galilee.  
  
###### 29  
As soon as Jesus and His companions had left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.  
  
###### 30  
Simon’s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a fever, and they promptly told Jesus about her.  
  
###### 31  
So He went to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.  
  
###### 32  
That evening, after sunset, people brought to Jesus all who were sick and demon-possessed,  
  
###### 33  
and the whole town gathered at the door.  
  
###### 34  
And He healed many who were ill with various diseases and drove out many demons. But He would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who He was.  
  
###### 35  
Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up and slipped out to a solitary place to pray.  
  
###### 36  
Simon and his companions went to look for Him,  
  
###### 37  
and when they found Him, they said, “Everyone is looking for You!”  
  
###### 38  
But Jesus answered, “Let us go on to the neighboring towns so I can preach there as well, for that is why I have come.”  
  
###### 39  
So He went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.  
  
###### 40  
Then a leper came to Jesus, begging on his knees: “If You are willing, You can make me clean.”  
  
###### 41  
Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” He said. “Be clean!”  
  
###### 42  
And immediately the leprosy left him, and the man was cleansed.  
  
###### 43  
Jesus promptly sent him away with a stern warning:  
  
###### 44  
“See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering Moses prescribed for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”  
  
###### 45  
But the man went out and openly began to proclaim and spread the news. Consequently, Jesus could no longer enter a town in plain view, but He stayed out in solitary places. Yet people came to Him from every quarter.
