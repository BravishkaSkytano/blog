###### 1  
Then Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people: “Keep all the commandments I am giving you today.  
  
###### 2  
And on the day you cross the Jordan into the land that the LORD your God is giving you, set up large stones and coat them with plaster.  
  
###### 3  
Write on them all the words of this law when you have crossed over to enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you.  
  
###### 4  
And when you have crossed the Jordan, you are to set up these stones on Mount Ebal, as I am commanding you today, and you are to coat them with plaster.  
  
###### 5  
Moreover, you are to build there an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones. You must not use any iron tool on them.  
  
###### 6  
You shall build the altar of the LORD your God with uncut stones and offer upon it burnt offerings to the LORD your God.  
  
###### 7  
There you are to sacrifice your peace offerings, eating them and rejoicing in the presence of the LORD your God.  
  
###### 8  
And you shall write distinctly upon these stones all the words of this law.”  
  
###### 9  
Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel: “Be silent, O Israel, and listen! This day you have become the people of the LORD your God.  
  
###### 10  
You shall therefore obey the voice of the LORD your God and follow His commandments and statutes I am giving you today.”  
  
###### 11  
On that day Moses commanded the people:  
  
###### 12  
“When you have crossed the Jordan, these tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.  
  
###### 13  
And these tribes shall stand on Mount Ebal to deliver the curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.  
  
###### 14  
Then the Levites shall proclaim in a loud voice to every Israelite:  
  
###### 15  
‘Cursed is the man who makes a carved idol or molten image—an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of a craftsman—and sets it up in secret.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’  
  
###### 16  
‘Cursed is he who dishonors his father or mother.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’  
  
###### 17  
‘Cursed is he who moves his neighbor’s boundary stone.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’  
  
###### 18  
‘Cursed is he who lets a blind man wander in the road.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’  
  
###### 19  
‘Cursed is he who withholds justice from the foreigner, the fatherless, or the widow.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’  
  
###### 20  
‘Cursed is he who sleeps with his father’s wife, for he has violated his father’s marriage bed.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’  
  
###### 21  
‘Cursed is he who lies with any animal.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’  
  
###### 22  
‘Cursed is he who sleeps with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’  
  
###### 23  
‘Cursed is he who sleeps with his mother-in-law.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’  
  
###### 24  
‘Cursed is he who strikes down his neighbor in secret.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’  
  
###### 25  
‘Cursed is he who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’  
  
###### 26  
‘Cursed is he who does not put the words of this law into practice.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’
