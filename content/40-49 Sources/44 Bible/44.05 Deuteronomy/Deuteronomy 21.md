###### 1  
If one is found slain, lying in a field in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess, and it is not known who killed him,  
  
###### 2  
your elders and judges must come out and measure the distance from the victim to the neighboring cities.  
  
###### 3  
Then the elders of the city nearest the victim shall take a heifer that has never been yoked or used for work,  
  
###### 4  
bring the heifer to a valley with running water that has not been plowed or sown, and break its neck there by the stream.  
  
###### 5  
And the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come forward, for the LORD your God has chosen them to serve Him and pronounce blessings in His name and to give a ruling in every dispute and case of assault.  
  
###### 6  
Then all the elders of the city nearest the victim shall wash their hands by the stream over the heifer whose neck has been broken,  
  
###### 7  
and they shall declare, “Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it.  
  
###### 8  
Accept this atonement, O LORD, for Your people Israel whom You have redeemed, and do not hold the shedding of innocent blood against them.” And the bloodshed will be atoned for.  
  
###### 9  
So you shall purge from among you the guilt of shedding innocent blood, since you have done what is right in the eyes of the LORD.  
  
###### 10  
When you go to war against your enemies and the LORD your God delivers them into your hand and you take them captive,  
  
###### 11  
if you see a beautiful woman among them, and you desire her and want to take her as your wife,  
  
###### 12  
then you shall bring her into your house. She must shave her head, trim her nails,  
  
###### 13  
and put aside the clothing of her captivity. After she has lived in your house a full month and mourned her father and mother, you may have relations with her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.  
  
###### 14  
And if you are not pleased with her, you are to let her go wherever she wishes. But you must not sell her for money or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her.  
  
###### 15  
If a man has two wives, one beloved and the other unloved, and both bear him sons, but the unloved wife has the firstborn son,  
  
###### 16  
when that man assigns his inheritance to his sons he must not appoint the son of the beloved wife as the firstborn over the son of the unloved wife.  
  
###### 17  
Instead, he must acknowledge the firstborn, the son of his unloved wife, by giving him a double portion of all that he has. For that son is the firstfruits of his father’s strength; the right of the firstborn belongs to him.  
  
###### 18  
If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and does not listen to them when disciplined,  
  
###### 19  
his father and mother are to lay hold of him and bring him to the elders of his city, to the gate of his hometown,  
  
###### 20  
and say to the elders, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he does not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.”  
  
###### 21  
Then all the men of his city will stone him to death. So you must purge the evil from among you, and all Israel will hear and be afraid.  
  
###### 22  
If a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is executed, and you hang his body on a tree,  
  
###### 23  
you must not leave the body on the tree overnight, but you must be sure to bury him that day, because anyone who is hung on a tree is under God’s curse. You must not defile the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
