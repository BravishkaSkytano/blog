###### 1  
When Moses had finished speaking these words to all Israel,  
  
###### 2  
he said to them, “I am now a hundred and twenty years old; I am no longer able to come and go, and the LORD has said to me, ‘You shall not cross the Jordan.’  
  
###### 3  
The LORD your God Himself will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you will dispossess them. Joshua will cross ahead of you, as the LORD has said.  
  
###### 4  
And the LORD will do to them as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, when He destroyed them along with their land.  
  
###### 5  
The LORD will deliver them over to you, and you must do to them exactly as I have commanded you.  
  
###### 6  
Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid or terrified of them, for it is the LORD your God who goes with you; He will never leave you nor forsake you.”  
  
###### 7  
Then Moses called for Joshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you will go with this people into the land that the LORD swore to their fathers to give them, and you shall give it to them as an inheritance.  
  
###### 8  
The LORD Himself goes before you; He will be with you. He will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid or discouraged.”  
  
###### 9  
So Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.  
  
###### 10  
Then Moses commanded them, “At the end of every seven years, at the appointed time in the year of remission of debt, during the Feast of Tabernacles,  
  
###### 11  
when all Israel comes before the LORD your God at the place He will choose, you are to read this law in the hearing of all Israel.  
  
###### 12  
Assemble the people—men, women, children, and the foreigners within your gates—so that they may listen and learn to fear the LORD your God and to follow carefully all the words of this law.  
  
###### 13  
Then their children who do not know the law will listen and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as you live in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”  
  
###### 14  
Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, the time of your death is near. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the Tent of Meeting, so that I may commission him.” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the Tent of Meeting.  
  
###### 15  
Then the LORD appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood over the entrance to the tent.  
  
###### 16  
And the LORD said to Moses, “You will soon rest with your fathers, and these people will rise up and prostitute themselves with the foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will forsake Me and break the covenant I have made with them.  
  
###### 17  
On that day My anger will burn against them, and I will abandon them and hide My face from them, so that they will be consumed, and many troubles and afflictions will befall them. On that day they will say, ‘Have not these disasters come upon us because our God is no longer with us?’  
  
###### 18  
And on that day I will surely hide My face because of all the evil they have done by turning to other gods.  
  
###### 19  
Now therefore, write down for yourselves this song and teach it to the Israelites; have them recite it, so that it may be a witness for Me against them.  
  
###### 20  
When I have brought them into the land that I swore to give their fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey, they will eat their fill and prosper. Then they will turn to other gods and worship them, and they will reject Me and break My covenant.  
  
###### 21  
And when many troubles and afflictions have come upon them, this song will testify against them, because it will not be forgotten from the lips of their descendants. For I know their inclination, even before I bring them into the land that I swore to give them.”  
  
###### 22  
So that very day Moses wrote down this song and taught it to the Israelites.  
  
###### 23  
Then the LORD commissioned Joshua son of Nun and said, “Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land that I swore to give them, and I will be with you.”  
  
###### 24  
When Moses had finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning to end,  
  
###### 25  
he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD:  
  
###### 26  
“Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, so that it may remain there as a witness against you.  
  
###### 27  
For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you are already rebelling against the LORD while I am still alive, how much more will you rebel after my death!  
  
###### 28  
Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officers so that I may speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to witness against them.  
  
###### 29  
For I know that after my death you will become utterly corrupt and turn from the path I have commanded you. And in the days to come, disaster will befall you because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke Him to anger by the work of your hands.”  
  
###### 30  
Then Moses recited aloud to the whole assembly of Israel the words of this song from beginning to end:
