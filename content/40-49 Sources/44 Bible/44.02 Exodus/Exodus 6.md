###### 1  
But the LORD said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh, for because of My mighty hand he will let the people go; because of My strong hand he will drive them out of his land.”  
  
###### 2  
God also told Moses, “I am the LORD.  
  
###### 3  
I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by My name the LORD I did not make Myself known to them.  
  
###### 4  
I also established My covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land where they lived as foreigners.  
  
###### 5  
Furthermore, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered My covenant.  
  
###### 6  
Therefore tell the Israelites: ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians and deliver you from their bondage. I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.  
  
###### 7  
I will take you as My own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.  
  
###### 8  
And I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD!’”

###### 10  
So the LORD said to Moses,  
  
###### 11  
“Go and tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his land.”  
  
###### 12  
But in the LORD’s presence Moses replied, “If the Israelites will not listen to me, then why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I am unskilled in speech?”  
  
###### 13  
Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them a charge concerning both the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.

###### 27  
Moses and Aaron were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt in order to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.

###### 29  
He said to him, “I am the LORD; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I say to you.”  
  
###### 30  
But in the LORD’s presence Moses replied, “Since I am unskilled in speech, why would Pharaoh listen to me?”
