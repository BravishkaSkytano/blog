###### 1  
These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:  
  
###### 2  
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;  
  
###### 3  
Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;  
  
###### 4  
Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.  
  
###### 5  
The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all, including Joseph, who was already in Egypt.  
  
###### 6  
Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,  
  
###### 7  
but the Israelites were fruitful and increased rapidly; they multiplied and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.  
  
###### 8  
Then a new king, who did not know Joseph, came to power in Egypt.  
  
###### 9  
“Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become too numerous and too powerful for us.  
  
###### 10  
Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, or they will increase even more; and if a war breaks out, they may join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the country.”  
  
###### 11  
So the Egyptians appointed taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor. As a result, they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.  
  
###### 12  
But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and flourished; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites.  
  
###### 13  
They worked the Israelites ruthlessly  
  
###### 14  
and made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar, and with all kinds of work in the fields. Every service they imposed was harsh.  
  
###### 15  
Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,  
  
###### 16  
“When you help the Hebrew women give birth, observe them on the birthstools. If the child is a son, kill him; but if it is a daughter, let her live.”  
  
###### 17  
The midwives, however, feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt had instructed; they let the boys live.  
  
###### 18  
So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?”  
  
###### 19  
The midwives answered Pharaoh, “The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before a midwife arrives.”  
  
###### 20  
So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied and became even more numerous.  
  
###### 21  
And because the midwives feared God, He gave them families of their own.  
  
###### 22  
Then Pharaoh commanded all his people: “Every son born to the Hebrews you must throw into the Nile, but every daughter you may allow to live.”
