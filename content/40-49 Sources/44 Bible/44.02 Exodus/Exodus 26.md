###### 1  
“You are to construct the tabernacle itself with ten curtains of finely spun linen, each with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and cherubim skillfully worked into them.  
  
###### 2  
Each curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide—all curtains the same size.  
  
###### 3  
Five of the curtains are to be joined together, and the other five joined as well.  
  
###### 4  
Make loops of blue material on the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and do the same for the end curtain in the second set.  
  
###### 5  
Make fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the second set, so that the loops line up opposite one another.  
  
###### 6  
Make fifty gold clasps as well, and join the curtains together with the clasps, so that the tabernacle will be a unit.  
  
###### 7  
You are to make curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven curtains in all.  
  
###### 8  
Each of the eleven curtains is to be the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.  
  
###### 9  
Join five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another. Then fold the sixth curtain over double at the front of the tent.  
  
###### 10  
Make fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and fifty loops along the edge of the corresponding curtain in the second set.  
  
###### 11  
Make fifty bronze clasps and put them through the loops to join the tent together as a unit.  
  
###### 12  
As for the overlap that remains of the tent curtains, the half curtain that is left over shall hang down over the back of the tabernacle.  
  
###### 13  
And the tent curtains will be a cubit longer on either side, and the excess will hang over the sides of the tabernacle to cover it.  
  
###### 14  
Also make a covering for the tent out of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of fine leather.  
  
###### 15  
You are to construct upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.  
  
###### 16  
Each frame is to be ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.  
  
###### 17  
Two tenons must be connected to each other for each frame. Make all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.  
  
###### 18  
Construct twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle,  
  
###### 19  
with forty silver bases under the twenty frames—two bases for each frame, one under each tenon.  
  
###### 20  
For the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, make twenty frames  
  
###### 21  
and forty silver bases—two bases under each frame.  
  
###### 22  
Make six frames for the rear of the tabernacle, the west side,  
  
###### 23  
and two frames for the two back corners of the tabernacle,  
  
###### 24  
coupled together from bottom to top and fitted into a single ring. These will serve as the two corners.  
  
###### 25  
So there are to be eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame.  
  
###### 26  
You are also to make five crossbars of acacia wood for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,  
  
###### 27  
five for those on the other side, and five for those on the rear side of the tabernacle, to the west.  
  
###### 28  
The central crossbar in the middle of the frames shall extend from one end to the other.  
  
###### 29  
Overlay the frames with gold and make gold rings to hold the crossbars. Also overlay the crossbars with gold.  
  
###### 30  
So you are to set up the tabernacle according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.  
  
###### 31  
Make a veil of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen, with cherubim skillfully worked into it.  
  
###### 32  
Hang it with gold hooks on four posts of acacia wood, overlaid with gold and standing on four silver bases.  
  
###### 33  
And hang the veil from the clasps and place the ark of the Testimony behind the veil. So the veil will separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place.  
  
###### 34  
Put the mercy seat on the ark of the Testimony in the Most Holy Place.  
  
###### 35  
And place the table outside the veil on the north side of the tabernacle, and put the lampstand opposite the table, on the south side.  
  
###### 36  
For the entrance to the tent, you are to make a curtain embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen.  
  
###### 37  
Make five posts of acacia wood for the curtain, overlay them with gold hooks, and cast five bronze bases for them.
