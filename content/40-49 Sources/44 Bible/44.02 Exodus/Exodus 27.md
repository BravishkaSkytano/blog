All the posts around the courtyard shall have silver bands, silver hooks, and bronze bases.

The entire courtyard shall be a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide, with curtains of finely spun linen five cubits high, and with bronze bases.  
  
###### 19  
All the utensils of the tabernacle for every use, including all its tent pegs and the tent pegs of the courtyard, shall be made of bronze.  
  
###### 20  
And you are to command the Israelites to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to keep the lamps burning continually.  
  
###### 21  
In the Tent of Meeting, outside the veil that is in front of the Testimony, Aaron and his sons are to tend the lamps before the LORD from evening until morning. This is to be a permanent statute for the Israelites for the generations to come.
