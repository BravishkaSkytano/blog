###### 1  
Then the LORD said to me, “Take a large scroll and write on it with an ordinary stylus: Maher-shalal-hash-baz.  
  
###### 2  
And I will appoint for Myself trustworthy witnesses—Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah.”  
  
###### 3  
And I had relations with the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. The LORD said to me, “Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz.  
  
###### 4  
For before the boy knows how to cry ‘Father’ or ‘Mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria.”  
  
###### 5  
And the LORD spoke to me further:  
  
###### 6  
“Because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoiced in Rezin and the son of Remaliah,  
  
###### 7  
the Lord will surely bring against them the mighty floodwaters of the Euphrates—the king of Assyria and all his pomp. It will overflow its channels and overrun its banks.  
  
###### 8  
It will pour into Judah, swirling and sweeping over it, reaching up to the neck; its spreading streams will cover your entire land, O Immanuel!  
  
###### 9  
Huddle together, O peoples, and be shattered; pay attention, all you distant lands; prepare for battle, and be shattered; prepare for battle, and be shattered!  
  
###### 10  
Devise a plan, but it will be thwarted; state a proposal, but it will not happen. For God is with us.”  
  
###### 11  
For this is what the LORD has spoken to me with a strong hand, instructing me not to walk in the way of this people:  
  
###### 12  
“Do not call conspiracy everything these people regard as conspiracy. Do not fear what they fear; do not live in dread.  
  
###### 13  
The LORD of Hosts is the One you shall regard as holy. Only He should be feared; only He should be dreaded.  
  
###### 14  
And He will be a sanctuary—but to both houses of Israel a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, to the dwellers of Jerusalem a trap and a snare.  
  
###### 15  
Many will stumble over these; they will fall and be broken; they will be ensnared and captured.”  
  
###### 16  
Bind up the testimony and seal the law among my disciples.  
  
###### 17  
I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob. I will put my trust in Him.  
  
###### 18  
Here am I, and the children the LORD has given me as signs and symbols in Israel from the LORD of Hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.  
  
###### 19  
When men tell you to consult the spirits of the dead and the spiritists who whisper and mutter, shouldn’t a people consult their God instead? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?  
  
###### 20  
To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn.  
  
###### 21  
They will roam the land, dejected and hungry. When they are famished, they will become enraged; and looking upward, they will curse their king and their God.  
  
###### 22  
Then they will look to the earth and see only distress and darkness and the gloom of anguish. And they will be driven into utter darkness.
