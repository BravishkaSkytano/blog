###### 1  
This is the burden against Moab: Ar in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! Kir in Moab is devastated, destroyed in a night!  
  
###### 2  
Dibon goes up to its temple to weep at its high places. Moab wails over Nebo, as well as over Medeba. Every head is shaved, every beard is cut off.  
  
###### 3  
In its streets they wear sackcloth; on the rooftops and in the public squares they all wail, falling down weeping.  
  
###### 4  
Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; their voices are heard as far as Jahaz. Therefore the soldiers of Moab cry out; their souls tremble within.  
  
###### 5  
My heart cries out over Moab; her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath-shelishiyah. With weeping they ascend the slope of Luhith; they lament their destruction on the road to Horonaim.  
  
###### 6  
The waters of Nimrim are dried up, and the grass is withered; the vegetation is gone, and the greenery is no more.  
  
###### 7  
So they carry their wealth and belongings over the Brook of the Willows.  
  
###### 8  
For their outcry echoes to the border of Moab. Their wailing reaches Eglaim; it is heard in Beer-elim.  
  
###### 9  
The waters of Dimon are full of blood, but I will bring more upon Dimon—a lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon the remnant of the land.
