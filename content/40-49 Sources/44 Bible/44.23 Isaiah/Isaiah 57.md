###### 1  
The righteous perish, and no one takes it to heart; devout men are swept away, while no one considers that the righteous are guided from the presence of evil.  
  
###### 2  
Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest, lying down in death.  
  
###### 3  
“But come here, you sons of a sorceress, you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes!  
  
###### 4  
Whom are you mocking? At whom do you snarl and stick out your tongue? Are you not children of transgression, offspring of deceit,  
  
###### 5  
who burn with lust among the oaks, under every luxuriant tree, who slaughter your children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?  
  
###### 6  
Your portion is among the smooth stones of the valley; indeed, they are your lot. Even to them you have poured out a drink offering and offered a grain offering. Should I relent because of these?  
  
###### 7  
On a high and lofty hill you have made your bed, and there you went up to offer sacrifices.  
  
###### 8  
Behind the door and doorpost you have set up your memorial. Forsaking Me, you uncovered your bed; you climbed up and opened it wide. And you have made a pact with those whose bed you have loved; you have gazed upon their nakedness.  
  
###### 9  
You went to Molech with oil and multiplied your perfumes. You have sent your envoys a great distance; you have descended even to Sheol itself.  
  
###### 10  
You are wearied by your many journeys, but you did not say, “There is no hope!” You found renewal of your strength; therefore you did not grow weak.  
  
###### 11  
Whom have you dreaded and feared, so that you lied and failed to remember Me or take this to heart? Is it not because I have long been silent that you do not fear Me?  
  
###### 12  
I will expose your righteousness and your works, and they will not profit you.  
  
###### 13  
When you cry out, let your companies of idols deliver you! Yet the wind will carry off all of them, a breath will take them away. But he who seeks refuge in Me will inherit the land and possess My holy mountain.”  
  
###### 14  
And it will be said, “Build it up, build it up, prepare the way, take every obstacle out of the way of My people.”  
  
###### 15  
For thus says the One who is high and lifted up, who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: “I dwell in a high and holy place, and with the oppressed and humble in spirit, to restore the spirit of the lowly and revive the heart of the contrite.  
  
###### 16  
For I will not accuse you forever, nor will I always be angry; for then the spirit of man would grow weak before Me, with the breath of those I have made.  
  
###### 17  
I was enraged by his sinful greed, so I struck him and hid My face in anger; yet he kept turning back to the desires of his heart.  
  
###### 18  
I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; I will guide him and restore comfort to him and his mourners,  
  
###### 19  
bringing praise to their lips. Peace, peace to those far and near,” says the LORD, “and I will heal them.”  
  
###### 20  
But the wicked are like the storm-tossed sea, for it cannot be still, and its waves churn up mire and muck.  
  
###### 21  
“There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.”
