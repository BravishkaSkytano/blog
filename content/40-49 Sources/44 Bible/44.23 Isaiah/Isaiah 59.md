###### 1  
Surely the arm of the LORD is not too short to save, nor His ear too dull to hear.  
  
###### 2  
But your iniquities have built barriers between you and your God, and your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He does not hear.  
  
###### 3  
For your hands are stained with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue mutters injustice.  
  
###### 4  
No one calls for justice; no one pleads his case honestly. They rely on empty pleas; they tell lies; they conceive mischief and give birth to iniquity.  
  
###### 5  
They hatch the eggs of vipers and weave a spider’s web. Whoever eats their eggs will die; crack one open, and a viper is hatched.  
  
###### 6  
Their cobwebs cannot be made into clothing, and they cannot cover themselves with their works. Their deeds are sinful deeds, and acts of violence are in their hands.  
  
###### 7  
Their feet run to evil; they are swift to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are sinful thoughts; ruin and destruction lie in their wake.  
  
###### 8  
The way of peace they have not known, and there is no justice in their tracks. They have turned them into crooked paths; no one who treads on them will know peace.  
  
###### 9  
Therefore justice is far from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We hope for light, but there is darkness; for brightness, but we walk in gloom.  
  
###### 10  
Like the blind, we feel our way along the wall, groping like those without eyes. We stumble at midday as in the twilight; among the vigorous we are like the dead.  
  
###### 11  
We all growl like bears and moan like doves. We hope for justice, but find none, for salvation, but it is far from us.  
  
###### 12  
For our transgressions are multiplied before You, and our sins testify against us. Our transgressions are indeed with us, and we know our iniquities:  
  
###### 13  
rebelling and denying the LORD, turning away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering lies from the heart.  
  
###### 14  
So justice is turned away, and righteousness stands at a distance. For truth has stumbled in the public square, and honesty cannot enter.  
  
###### 15  
Truth is missing, and whoever turns from evil becomes prey. The LORD looked and was displeased that there was no justice.  
  
###### 16  
He saw that there was no man; He was amazed that there was no one to intercede. So His own arm brought salvation, and His own righteousness sustained Him.  
  
###### 17  
He put on righteousness like a breastplate, and the helmet of salvation on His head; He put on garments of vengeance and wrapped Himself in a cloak of zeal.  
  
###### 18  
So He will repay according to their deeds: fury to His enemies, retribution to His foes, and recompense to the islands.  
  
###### 19  
So shall they fear the name of the LORD where the sun sets, and His glory where it rises. For He will come like a raging flood, driven by the breath of the LORD.  
  
###### 20  
“The Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who turn from transgression,” declares the LORD.  
  
###### 21  
“As for Me, this is My covenant with them,” says the LORD. “My Spirit will not depart from you, and My words that I have put in your mouth will not depart from your mouth or from the mouths of your children and grandchildren, from now on and forevermore,” says the LORD.
