###### 1  
Behold, a king will reign in righteousness, and princes will rule with justice.  
  
###### 2  
Each will be like a shelter from the wind, a refuge from the storm, like streams of water in a dry land, like the shadow of a great rock in an arid land.  
  
###### 3  
Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed, and the ears of those who hear will listen.  
  
###### 4  
The mind of the rash will know and understand, and the stammering tongue will speak clearly and fluently.  
  
###### 5  
No longer will a fool be called noble, nor a scoundrel be respected.  
  
###### 6  
For a fool speaks foolishness; his mind plots iniquity. He practices ungodliness and speaks falsely about the LORD; he leaves the hungry empty and deprives the thirsty of drink.  
  
###### 7  
The weapons of the scoundrel are destructive; he hatches plots to destroy the poor with lies, even when the plea of the needy is just.  
  
###### 8  
But a noble man makes honorable plans; he stands up for worthy causes.  
  
###### 9  
Stand up, you complacent women; listen to me. Give ear to my word, you overconfident daughters.  
  
###### 10  
In a little more than a year you will tremble, O secure ones. For the grape harvest will fail and the fruit harvest will not arrive.  
  
###### 11  
Shudder, you ladies of leisure; tremble, you daughters of complacency. Strip yourselves bare and put sackcloth around your waists.  
  
###### 12  
Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vines,  
  
###### 13  
and for the land of my people, overgrown with thorns and briers—even for every house of merriment in this city of revelry.  
  
###### 14  
For the palace will be forsaken, the busy city abandoned. The hill and the watchtower will become caves forever—the delight of wild donkeys and a pasture for flocks—  
  
###### 15  
until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high. Then the desert will be an orchard, and the orchard will seem like a forest.  
  
###### 16  
Then justice will inhabit the wilderness, and righteousness will dwell in the fertile field.  
  
###### 17  
The work of righteousness will be peace; the service of righteousness will be quiet confidence forever.  
  
###### 18  
Then my people will dwell in a peaceful place, in safe and secure places of rest.  
  
###### 19  
But hail will level the forest, and the city will sink to the depths.  
  
###### 20  
Blessed are those who sow beside abundant waters, who let the ox and donkey range freely.
