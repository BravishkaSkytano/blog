###### 1  
In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted; and the train of His robe filled the temple.  
  
###### 2  
Above Him stood seraphim, each having six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.  
  
###### 3  
And they were calling out to one another: “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Hosts; all the earth is full of His glory.”  
  
###### 4  
At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook, and the temple was filled with smoke.  
  
###### 5  
Then I said: “Woe is me, for I am ruined, because I am a man of unclean lips dwelling among a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of Hosts.”  
  
###### 6  
Then one of the seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a glowing coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.  
  
###### 7  
And with it he touched my mouth and said: “Now that this has touched your lips, your iniquity is removed and your sin is atoned for.”  
  
###### 8  
Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying: “Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us?” And I said: “Here am I. Send me!”  
  
###### 9  
And He replied: “Go and tell this people, ‘Be ever hearing, but never understanding; be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’  
  
###### 10  
Make the hearts of this people calloused; deafen their ears and close their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.”  
  
###### 11  
Then I asked: “How long, O Lord?” And He replied: “Until the cities lie ruined and without inhabitant, until the houses are left unoccupied and the land is desolate and ravaged,  
  
###### 12  
until the LORD has driven men far away and the land is utterly forsaken.  
  
###### 13  
And though a tenth remains in the land, it will be burned again. As the terebinth and oak leave stumps when felled, so the holy seed will be a stump in the land.”
