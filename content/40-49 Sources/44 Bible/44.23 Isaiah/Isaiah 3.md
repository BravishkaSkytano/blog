###### 1  
For behold, the Lord GOD of Hosts is about to remove from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support: the whole supply of food and water,  
  
###### 2  
the mighty man and the warrior, the judge and the prophet, the soothsayer and the elder,  
  
###### 3  
the commander of fifty and the dignitary, the counselor, the cunning magician, and the clever enchanter.  
  
###### 4  
“I will make mere lads their leaders, and children will rule over them.”  
  
###### 5  
The people will oppress one another, man against man, neighbor against neighbor; the young will rise up against the old, and the base against the honorable.  
  
###### 6  
A man will seize his brother within his father’s house: “You have a cloak—you be our leader! Take charge of this heap of rubble.”  
  
###### 7  
On that day he will cry aloud: “I am not a healer. I have no food or clothing in my house. Do not make me leader of the people!”  
  
###### 8  
For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen because they spoke and acted against the LORD, defying His glorious presence.  
  
###### 9  
The expression on their faces testifies against them, and like Sodom they flaunt their sin; they do not conceal it. Woe to them, for they have brought disaster upon themselves.  
  
###### 10  
Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their labor.  
  
###### 11  
Woe to the wicked; disaster is upon them! For they will be repaid with what their hands have done.  
  
###### 12  
Youths oppress My people, and women rule over them. O My people, your guides mislead you; they turn you from your paths.  
  
###### 13  
The LORD arises to contend; He stands to judge the people.  
  
###### 14  
The LORD brings this charge against the elders and leaders of His people: “You have devoured the vineyard; the plunder of the poor is in your houses.  
  
###### 15  
Why do you crush My people and grind the faces of the poor?” declares the Lord GOD of Hosts.  
  
###### 16  
The LORD also says: “Because the daughters of Zion are haughty—walking with heads held high and wanton eyes, prancing and skipping as they go, jingling the bracelets on their ankles—  
  
###### 17  
the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will make their foreheads bare.”  
  
###### 18  
In that day the Lord will take away their finery: their anklets and headbands and crescents;  
  
###### 19  
their pendants, bracelets, and veils;  
  
###### 20  
their headdresses, ankle chains, and sashes; their perfume bottles and charms;  
  
###### 21  
their signet rings and nose rings;  
  
###### 22  
their festive robes, capes, cloaks, and purses;  
  
###### 23  
and their mirrors, linen garments, tiaras, and shawls.  
  
###### 24  
Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a belt, a rope; instead of styled hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, shame.  
  
###### 25  
Your men will fall by the sword, and your warriors in battle.  
  
###### 26  
And the gates of Zion will lament and mourn; destitute, she will sit on the ground.
