###### 9  
The special portion you set apart to the LORD shall be 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide.

###### 12  
It will be a special portion for them set apart from the land, a most holy portion adjacent to the territory of the Levites.  
  
###### 13  
Bordering the territory of the priests, the Levites shall have an area 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide. The whole length will be 25,000 cubits, and the width 10,000 cubits.  
  
###### 14  
They must not sell or exchange any of it, and they must not transfer this best part of the land, for it is holy to the LORD.  
  
###### 15  
The remaining area, 5,000 cubits wide and 25,000 cubits long, will be for common use by the city, for houses, and for pastureland. The city will be in the center of it  
  
###### 16  
and will have these measurements: 4,500 cubits on the north side, 4,500 cubits on the south side, 4,500 cubits on the east side, and 4,500 cubits on the west side.  
  
###### 17  
The pastureland of the city will extend 250 cubits to the north, 250 cubits to the south, 250 cubits to the east, and 250 cubits to the west.  
  
###### 18  
The remainder of the length bordering the holy portion and running adjacent to it will be 10,000 cubits on the east side and 10,000 cubits on the west side. Its produce will supply food for the workers of the city.  
  
###### 19  
The workers of the city who cultivate it will come from all the tribes of Israel.  
  
###### 20  
The entire portion will be a square, 25,000 cubits by 25,000 cubits. You are to set apart the holy portion, along with the city property.  
  
###### 21  
The remaining area on both sides of the holy portion and of the property of the city will belong to the prince. He will own the land adjacent to the tribal portions, extending eastward from the 25,000 cubits of the holy district toward the eastern border, and westward from the 25,000 cubits to the western border. And in the center of them will be the holy portion and the sanctuary of the temple.

###### 29  
This is the land you are to allot as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and these will be their portions,” declares the Lord GOD.  
  
###### 30  
“These will be the exits of the city: Beginning on the north side, which will be 4,500 cubits long,
