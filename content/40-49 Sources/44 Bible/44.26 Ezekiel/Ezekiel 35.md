###### 1  
Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,  
  
###### 2  
“Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it,  
  
###### 3  
and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: Behold, I am against you, O Mount Seir. I will stretch out My hand against you and make you a desolate waste.  
  
###### 4  
I will turn your cities into ruins, and you will become a desolation. Then you will know that I am the LORD.  
  
###### 5  
Because you harbored an ancient hatred and delivered the Israelites over to the sword in the time of their disaster at the final stage of their punishment,  
  
###### 6  
therefore as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will give you over to bloodshed and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, it will pursue you.  
  
###### 7  
I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and will cut off from it those who come and go.  
  
###### 8  
I will fill its mountains with the slain; those killed by the sword will fall on your hills, in your valleys, and in all your ravines.  
  
###### 9  
I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD.  
  
###### 10  
Because you have said, ‘These two nations and countries will be ours, and we will possess them,’ even though the LORD was there,  
  
###### 11  
therefore as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will treat you according to the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred against them, and I will make Myself known among them when I judge you.  
  
###### 12  
Then you will know that I, the LORD, have heard every contemptuous word you uttered against the mountains of Israel when you said, ‘They are desolate; they are given to us to devour!’  
  
###### 13  
You boasted against Me with your mouth and multiplied your words against Me. I heard it Myself!  
  
###### 14  
This is what the Lord GOD says: While the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.  
  
###### 15  
As you rejoiced when the inheritance of the house of Israel became desolate, so will I do to you. You will become a desolation, O Mount Seir, and so will all of Edom. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
