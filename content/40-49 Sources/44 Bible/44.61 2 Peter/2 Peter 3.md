###### 1  
Beloved, this is now my second letter to you. Both of them are reminders to stir you to wholesome thinking  
  
###### 2  
by recalling what was foretold by the holy prophets and commanded by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.  
  
###### 3  
Most importantly, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires.  
  
###### 4  
“Where is the promise of His coming?” they will ask. “Ever since our fathers fell asleep, everything continues as it has from the beginning of creation.”  
  
###### 5  
But they deliberately overlook the fact that long ago by God’s word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water,  
  
###### 6  
through which the world of that time perished in the flood.  
  
###### 7  
And by that same word, the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.  
  
###### 8  
Beloved, do not let this one thing escape your notice: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.  
  
###### 9  
The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise as some understand slowness, but is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance.  
  
###### 10  
But the Day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar, the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and its works will be laid bare.  
  
###### 11  
Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to conduct yourselves in holiness and godliness  
  
###### 12  
as you anticipate and hasten the coming of the day of God, when the heavens will be destroyed by fire and the elements will melt in the heat.  
  
###### 13  
But in keeping with God’s promise, we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells.  
  
###### 14  
Therefore, beloved, as you anticipate these things, make every effort to be found at peace—spotless and blameless in His sight.  
  
###### 15  
Consider also that our Lord’s patience brings salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom God gave him.  
  
###### 16  
He writes this way in all his letters, speaking in them about such matters. Some parts of his letters are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.  
  
###### 17  
Therefore, beloved, since you already know these things, be on your guard so that you will not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure standing.  
  
###### 18  
But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.
