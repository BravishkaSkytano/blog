###### 1  
Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,  
  
###### 2  
“Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They do not wash their hands before they eat.”  
  
###### 3  
Jesus replied, “And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?  
  
###### 4  
For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’ and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’  
  
###### 5  
But you say that if anyone says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would have received from me is a gift devoted to God,’  
  
###### 6  
he need not honor his father or mother with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.  
  
###### 7  
You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you:  
  
###### 8  
‘These people honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me.  
  
###### 9  
They worship Me in vain; they teach as doctrine the precepts of men.’”  
  
###### 10  
Jesus called the crowd to Him and said, “Listen and understand.  
  
###### 11  
A man is not defiled by what enters his mouth, but by what comes out of it.”  
  
###### 12  
Then the disciples came to Him and said, “Are You aware that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”  
  
###### 13  
But Jesus replied, “Every plant that My heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by its roots.  
  
###### 14  
Disregard them! They are blind guides. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.”  
  
###### 15  
Peter said to Him, “Explain this parable to us.”  
  
###### 16  
“Do you still not understand?” Jesus asked.  
  
###### 17  
“Do you not yet realize that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then is eliminated?  
  
###### 18  
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these things defile a man.  
  
###### 19  
For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and slander.  
  
###### 20  
These are what defile a man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile him.”  
  
###### 21  
Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon.  
  
###### 22  
And a Canaanite woman from that region came to Him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is miserably possessed by a demon.”  
  
###### 23  
But Jesus did not answer a word. So His disciples came and urged Him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”  
  
###### 24  
He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”  
  
###### 25  
The woman came and knelt before Him. “Lord, help me!” she said.  
  
###### 26  
But Jesus replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”  
  
###### 27  
“Yes, Lord,” she said, “even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.”  
  
###### 28  
“O woman,” Jesus answered, “your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that very hour.  
  
###### 29  
Moving on from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee. Then He went up on a mountain and sat down.  
  
###### 30  
Large crowds came to Him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and laid them at His feet, and He healed them.  
  
###### 31  
The crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled restored, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.  
  
###### 32  
Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, “I have compassion for this crowd, because they have already been with Me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may faint along the way.”  
  
###### 33  
The disciples replied, “Where in this desolate place could we find enough bread to feed such a large crowd?”  
  
###### 34  
“How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied, “and a few small fish.”  
  
###### 35  
And He instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground.  
  
###### 36  
Taking the seven loaves and the fish, He gave thanks and broke them. Then He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.  
  
###### 37  
They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.  
  
###### 38  
A total of four thousand men were fed, in addition to women and children.  
  
###### 39  
After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, He got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
