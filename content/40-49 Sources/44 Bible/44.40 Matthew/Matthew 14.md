###### 1  
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus  
  
###### 2  
and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”  
  
###### 3  
Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife,  
  
###### 4  
because John had been telling him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”  
  
###### 5  
Although Herod wanted to kill John, he was afraid of the people, because they regarded John as a prophet.  
  
###### 6  
On Herod’s birthday, however, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod  
  
###### 7  
so much that he promised with an oath to give to her whatever she asked.  
  
###### 8  
Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.”  
  
###### 9  
The king was grieved, but because of his oaths and his guests, he ordered that her wish be granted  
  
###### 10  
and sent to have John beheaded in the prison.  
  
###### 11  
John’s head was brought in on a platter and presented to the girl, who carried it to her mother.  
  
###### 12  
Then John’s disciples came and took his body and buried it. And they went and informed Jesus.  
  
###### 13  
When Jesus heard about John, He withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. But the crowds found out about it and followed Him on foot from the towns.  
  
###### 14  
When He stepped ashore and saw a large crowd, He had compassion on them and healed their sick.  
  
###### 15  
When evening came, the disciples came to Him and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is already late. Dismiss the crowds so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.”  
  
###### 16  
“They do not need to go away,” Jesus replied. “You give them something to eat.”  
  
###### 17  
“We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered.  
  
###### 18  
“Bring them here to Me,” Jesus said.  
  
###### 19  
And He directed the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, He spoke a blessing. Then He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.  
  
###### 20  
They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.  
  
###### 21  
About five thousand men were fed, in addition to women and children.  
  
###### 22  
Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of Him to the other side, while He dismissed the crowds.  
  
###### 23  
After He had sent them away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. When evening came, He was there alone,  
  
###### 24  
but the boat was already far from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.  
  
###### 25  
During the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea.  
  
###### 26  
When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost!” they said, and cried out in fear.  
  
###### 27  
But Jesus spoke up at once: “Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.”  
  
###### 28  
“Lord, if it is You,” Peter replied, “command me to come to You on the water.”  
  
###### 29  
“Come,” said Jesus. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.  
  
###### 30  
But when he saw the strength of the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!”  
  
###### 31  
Immediately Jesus reached out His hand and took hold of Peter. “You of little faith,” He said, “why did you doubt?”  
  
###### 32  
And when they had climbed back into the boat, the wind died down.  
  
###### 33  
Then those who were in the boat worshiped Him, saying, “Truly You are the Son of God!”  
  
###### 34  
When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret.  
  
###### 35  
And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding region. People brought all the sick to Him  
  
###### 36  
and begged Him just to let them touch the fringe of His cloak. And all who touched Him were healed.
