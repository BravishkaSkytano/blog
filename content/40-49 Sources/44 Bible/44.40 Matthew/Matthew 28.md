###### 1  
After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.  
  
###### 2  
Suddenly there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled away the stone, and sat on it.  
  
###### 3  
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.  
  
###### 4  
The guards trembled in fear of him and became like dead men.  
  
###### 5  
But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.  
  
###### 6  
He is not here; He has risen, just as He said! Come, see the place where He lay.  
  
###### 7  
Then go quickly and tell His disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see Him.’ See, I have told you.”  
  
###### 8  
So they hurried away from the tomb in fear and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples.  
  
###### 9  
Suddenly Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” They came to Him, grasped His feet, and worshiped Him.  
  
###### 10  
“Do not be afraid,” said Jesus. “Go and tell My brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see Me.”  
  
###### 11  
While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.  
  
###### 12  
And after the chief priests had met with the elders and formed a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money  
  
###### 13  
and instructed them: “You are to say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.’  
  
###### 14  
If this report reaches the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”  
  
###### 15  
So the guards took the money and did as they were instructed. And this account has been circulated among the Jews to this very day.  
  
###### 16  
Meanwhile, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain Jesus had designated.  
  
###### 17  
When they saw Him, they worshiped Him, but some doubted.  
  
###### 18  
Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.  
  
###### 19  
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,  
  
###### 20  
and teaching them to obey all that I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”
