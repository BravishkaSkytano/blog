###### 1  
“Do not judge, or you will be judged.  
  
###### 2  
For with the same judgment you pronounce, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.  
  
###### 3  
Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but fail to notice the beam in your own eye?  
  
###### 4  
How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ while there is still a beam in your own eye?  
  
###### 5  
You hypocrite! First take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.  
  
###### 6  
Do not give dogs what is holy; do not throw your pearls before swine. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces.  
  
###### 7  
Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.  
  
###### 8  
For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.  
  
###### 9  
Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?  
  
###### 10  
Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?  
  
###### 11  
So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!  
  
###### 12  
In everything, then, do to others as you would have them do to you. For this is the essence of the Law and the Prophets.  
  
###### 13  
Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.  
  
###### 14  
But small is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life, and only a few find it.  
  
###### 15  
Beware of false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.  
  
###### 16  
By their fruit you will recognize them. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?  
  
###### 17  
Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.  
  
###### 18  
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.  
  
###### 19  
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.  
  
###### 20  
So then, by their fruit you will recognize them.  
  
###### 21  
Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of My Father in heaven.  
  
###### 22  
Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’  
  
###### 23  
Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness!’  
  
###### 24  
Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.  
  
###### 25  
The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because its foundation was on the rock.  
  
###### 26  
But everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.  
  
###### 27  
The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell—and great was its collapse!”  
  
###### 28  
When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were astonished at His teaching,  
  
###### 29  
because He taught as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.
