and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.  
  
###### 17  
In all, then, there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ.  
  
###### 18  
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged in marriage to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.  
  
###### 19  
Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and was unwilling to disgrace her publicly, he resolved to divorce her quietly.  
  
###### 20  
But after he had pondered these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to embrace Mary as your wife, for the One conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.  
  
###### 21  
She will give birth to a Son, and you are to give Him the name Jesus, because He will save His people from their sins.”  
  
###### 22  
All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:  
  
###### 23  
“Behold, the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call Him Immanuel” (which means, “God with us”).  
  
###### 24  
When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and embraced Mary as his wife.  
  
###### 25  
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a Son. And he gave Him the name Jesus.
