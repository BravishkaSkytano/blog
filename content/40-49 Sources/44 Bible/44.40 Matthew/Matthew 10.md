###### 1  
And calling His twelve disciples to Him, Jesus gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they could drive them out and heal every disease and sickness.  
  
###### 2  
These are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John;  
  
###### 3  
Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;  
  
###### 4  
Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus.  
  
###### 5  
These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: “Do not go onto the road of the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.  
  
###### 6  
Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.  
  
###### 7  
As you go, preach this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven is near.’  
  
###### 8  
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.  
  
###### 9  
Do not carry any gold or silver or copper in your belts.  
  
###### 10  
Take no bag for the road, or second tunic, or sandals, or staff; for the worker is worthy of his provisions.  
  
###### 11  
Whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy there and stay at his house until you move on.  
  
###### 12  
As you enter the home, greet its occupants.  
  
###### 13  
If the home is worthy, let your peace rest on it; but if it is not, let your peace return to you.  
  
###### 14  
And if anyone will not welcome you or heed your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town.  
  
###### 15  
Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.  
  
###### 16  
Behold, I am sending you out like sheep among wolves; therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.  
  
###### 17  
But beware of men; for they will hand you over to their councils and flog you in their synagogues.  
  
###### 18  
On My account, you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.  
  
###### 19  
But when they hand you over, do not worry about how to respond or what to say. In that hour you will be given what to say.  
  
###### 20  
For it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.  
  
###### 21  
Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rise against their parents and have them put to death.  
  
###### 22  
You will be hated by everyone because of My name, but the one who perseveres to the end will be saved.  
  
###### 23  
When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next. Truly I tell you, you will not reach all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.  
  
###### 24  
A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.  
  
###### 25  
It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household!  
  
###### 26  
So do not be afraid of them. For there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known.  
  
###### 27  
What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the housetops.  
  
###### 28  
Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.  
  
###### 29  
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father.  
  
###### 30  
And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.  
  
###### 31  
So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.  
  
###### 32  
Therefore everyone who confesses Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father in heaven.  
  
###### 33  
But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father in heaven.  
  
###### 34  
Do not assume that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.  
  
###### 35  
For I have come to turn ‘a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.  
  
###### 36  
A man’s enemies will be the members of his own household.’  
  
###### 37  
Anyone who loves his father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me;  
  
###### 38  
and anyone who does not take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me.  
  
###### 39  
Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.  
  
###### 40  
He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives the One who sent Me.  
  
###### 41  
Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and whoever receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward.  
  
###### 42  
And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is My disciple, truly I tell you, he will never lose his reward.”
