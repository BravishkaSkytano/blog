###### 1  
And David sang this song to the LORD on the day the LORD had delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.  
  
###### 2  
He said: “The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer.  
  
###### 3  
My God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation. My stronghold, my refuge, and my Savior, You save me from violence.  
  
###### 4  
I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised; so shall I be saved from my enemies.  
  
###### 5  
For the waves of death engulfed me; the torrents of chaos overwhelmed me.  
  
###### 6  
The cords of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me.  
  
###### 7  
In my distress I called upon the LORD; I cried out to my God. And from His temple He heard my voice, and my cry for help reached His ears.  
  
###### 8  
Then the earth shook and quaked; the foundations of the heavens trembled; they were shaken because He burned with anger.  
  
###### 9  
Smoke rose from His nostrils, and consuming fire came from His mouth; glowing coals blazed forth.  
  
###### 10  
He parted the heavens and came down with dark clouds beneath His feet.  
  
###### 11  
He mounted a cherub and flew; He soared on the wings of the wind.  
  
###### 12  
He made darkness a canopy around Him, a gathering of water and thick clouds.  
  
###### 13  
From the brightness of His presence coals of fire blazed forth.  
  
###### 14  
The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded.  
  
###### 15  
He shot His arrows and scattered the foes; He hurled lightning and routed them.  
  
###### 16  
The channels of the sea appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed at the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of His nostrils.  
  
###### 17  
He reached down from on high and took hold of me; He drew me out of deep waters.  
  
###### 18  
He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from foes too mighty for me.  
  
###### 19  
They confronted me in my day of calamity, but the LORD was my support.  
  
###### 20  
He brought me out into the open; He rescued me because He delighted in me.  
  
###### 21  
The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness; He has repaid me according to the cleanness of my hands.  
  
###### 22  
For I have kept the ways of the LORD and have not wickedly departed from my God.  
  
###### 23  
For all His ordinances are before me; I have not disregarded His statutes.  
  
###### 24  
And I have been blameless before Him and kept myself from iniquity.  
  
###### 25  
So the LORD has repaid me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in His sight.  
  
###### 26  
To the faithful You show Yourself faithful, to the blameless You show Yourself blameless;  
  
###### 27  
to the pure You show Yourself pure, but to the crooked You show Yourself shrewd.  
  
###### 28  
You save an afflicted people, but Your eyes are on the haughty to bring them down.  
  
###### 29  
For You, O LORD, are my lamp; the LORD lights up my darkness.  
  
###### 30  
For in You I can charge an army; with my God I can scale a wall.  
  
###### 31  
As for God, His way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless. He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.  
  
###### 32  
For who is God besides the LORD? And who is the Rock except our God?  
  
###### 33  
God is my strong fortress and He makes my way clear.  
  
###### 34  
He makes my feet like those of a deer and stations me upon the heights.  
  
###### 35  
He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.  
  
###### 36  
You have given me Your shield of salvation, and Your gentleness exalts me.  
  
###### 37  
You broaden the path beneath me so that my ankles do not give way.  
  
###### 38  
I pursued my enemies and destroyed them; I did not turn back until they were consumed.  
  
###### 39  
I devoured and crushed them so they could not rise; they have fallen under my feet.  
  
###### 40  
You have armed me with strength for battle; You have subdued my foes beneath me.  
  
###### 41  
You have made my enemies retreat before me; I put an end to those who hated me.  
  
###### 42  
They looked, but there was no one to save them—to the LORD, but He did not answer.  
  
###### 43  
I ground them as the dust of the earth; I crushed and trampled them like mud in the streets.  
  
###### 44  
You have delivered me from the strife of my people; You have preserved me as the head of nations; a people I had not known shall serve me.  
  
###### 45  
Foreigners cower before me; when they hear me, they obey me.  
  
###### 46  
Foreigners lose heart and come trembling from their strongholds.  
  
###### 47  
The LORD lives, and blessed be my Rock! And may God, the Rock of my salvation, be exalted—  
  
###### 48  
the God who avenges me and brings down nations beneath me,  
  
###### 49  
who frees me from my enemies. You exalt me above my foes; You rescue me from violent men.  
  
###### 50  
Therefore I will praise You, O LORD, among the nations; I will sing praises to Your name.  
  
###### 51  
Great salvation He brings to His king. He shows loving devotion to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.”
