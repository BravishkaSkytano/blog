###### 53  
“The land is to be divided among the tribes as an inheritance, according to the number of names.

Increase the inheritance for a large tribe and decrease it for a small one; each tribe is to receive its inheritance according to the number of those registered.

Indeed, the land must be divided by lot; they shall receive their inheritance according to the names of the tribes of their fathers.
