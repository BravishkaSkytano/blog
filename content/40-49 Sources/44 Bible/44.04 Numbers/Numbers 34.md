###### 1  
Then the LORD said to Moses,  
  
###### 2  
“Command the Israelites and say to them: When you enter the land of Canaan, it will be allotted to you as an inheritance with these boundaries:  
  
###### 3  
Your southern border will extend from the Wilderness of Zin along the border of Edom. On the east, your southern border will run from the end of the Salt Sea,  
  
###### 4  
cross south of the Ascent of Akrabbim, continue to Zin, and go south of Kadesh-barnea. Then it will go on to Hazar-addar and proceed to Azmon,  
  
###### 5  
where it will turn from Azmon, join the Brook of Egypt, and end at the Sea.  
  
###### 6  
Your western border will be the coastline of the Great Sea; this will be your boundary on the west.  
  
###### 7  
Your northern border will run from the Great Sea directly to Mount Hor,  
  
###### 8  
and from Mount Hor to Lebo-hamath, then extend to Zedad,  
  
###### 9  
continue to Ziphron, and end at Hazar-enan. This will be your boundary on the north.  
  
###### 10  
And your eastern border will run straight from Hazar-enan to Shepham,  
  
###### 11  
then go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain and continue along the slopes east of the Sea of Chinnereth.  
  
###### 12  
Then the border will go down along the Jordan and end at the Salt Sea. This will be your land, defined by its borders on all sides.”  
  
###### 13  
So Moses commanded the Israelites, “Apportion this land by lot as an inheritance. The LORD has commanded that it be given to the nine and a half tribes.  
  
###### 14  
For the tribes of the Reubenites and Gadites, along with the half-tribe of Manasseh, have already received their inheritance.  
  
###### 15  
These two and a half tribes have received their inheritance across the Jordan from Jericho, toward the sunrise.”  
  
###### 16  
Then the LORD said to Moses,  
  
###### 17  
“These are the names of the men who are to assign the land as an inheritance for you: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun.  
  
###### 18  
Appoint one leader from each tribe to distribute the land.  
  
###### 19  
These are their names: Caleb son of Jephunneh from the tribe of Judah;  
  
###### 20  
Shemuel son of Ammihud from the tribe of Simeon;  
  
###### 21  
Elidad son of Chislon from the tribe of Benjamin;  
  
###### 22  
Bukki son of Jogli, a leader from the tribe of Dan;  
  
###### 23  
Hanniel son of Ephod, a leader from the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph;  
  
###### 24  
Kemuel son of Shiphtan, a leader from the tribe of Ephraim;  
  
###### 25  
Eli-zaphan son of Parnach, a leader from the tribe of Zebulun;  
  
###### 26  
Paltiel son of Azzan, a leader from the tribe of Issachar;  
  
###### 27  
Ahihud son of Shelomi, a leader from the tribe of Asher;  
  
###### 28  
and Pedahel son of Ammihud, a leader from the tribe of Naphtali.”  
  
###### 29  
These are the ones whom the LORD commanded to apportion the inheritance to the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
