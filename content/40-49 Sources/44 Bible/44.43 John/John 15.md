###### 1  
“I am the true vine, and My Father is the keeper of the vineyard.  
  
###### 2  
He cuts off every branch in Me that bears no fruit, and every branch that does bear fruit, He prunes to make it even more fruitful.  
  
###### 3  
You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.  
  
###### 4  
Remain in Me, and I will remain in you. Just as no branch can bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me.  
  
###### 5  
I am the vine and you are the branches. The one who remains in Me, and I in him, will bear much fruit. For apart from Me you can do nothing.  
  
###### 6  
If anyone does not remain in Me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers. Such branches are gathered up, thrown into the fire, and burned.  
  
###### 7  
If you remain in Me and My words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.  
  
###### 8  
This is to My Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, proving yourselves to be My disciples.  
  
###### 9  
As the Father has loved Me, so have I loved you. Remain in My love.  
  
###### 10  
If you keep My commandments, you will remain in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and remain in His love.  
  
###### 11  
I have told you these things so that My joy may be in you and your joy may be complete.  
  
###### 12  
This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.  
  
###### 13  
Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.  
  
###### 14  
You are My friends if you do what I command you.  
  
###### 15  
No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not understand what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because everything I have learned from My Father I have made known to you.  
  
###### 16  
You did not choose Me, but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit—fruit that will remain—so that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give you.  
  
###### 17  
This is My command to you: Love one another.  
  
###### 18  
If the world hates you, understand that it hated Me first.  
  
###### 19  
If you were of the world, it would love you as its own. Instead, the world hates you, because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world.  
  
###### 20  
Remember the word that I spoke to you: ‘No servant is greater than his master.’ If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you as well; if they kept My word, they will keep yours as well.  
  
###### 21  
But they will treat you like this because of My name, since they do not know the One who sent Me.  
  
###### 22  
If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin.  
  
###### 23  
Whoever hates Me hates My Father as well.  
  
###### 24  
If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have seen and hated both Me and My Father.  
  
###### 25  
But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: ‘They hated Me without reason.’  
  
###### 26  
When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father—He will testify about Me.  
  
###### 27  
And you also must testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning.
