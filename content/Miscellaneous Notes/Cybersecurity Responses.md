## Why is Cybersecurity Important?  
  
With the rise of technology comes a price. We're all so dependent on technology for important aspects of our lives, and there are people who would pay a lot of money to get access to those important aspects. Consequently, there are hundreds, maybe even thousands, of hackers who are looking for ways to get into businesses and corporations to steal precious info and sell it on the black market. The best way to protect against those hackers is through cybersecurity, hiring someone to fend off hackers by securing those resources from people who don't need them.  
  
## Why Are You Interested in a Career in Cybersecurity?  
  
Cybersecurity interests me because I like learning about technology and the threats that affect it. Privacy is becoming a big thing for me, and having a strong foundation in cybersecurity will go a long way towards my comfort and peace-of-mind. Not only that, but it's a high demand job that has great entry-level positions that don't necessarily require a degree. And, there it requires you to continue to learn and grow, so there will always be a new puzzle for me to figure out.
