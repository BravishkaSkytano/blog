The Hailey’s are helping a local pastor build a bigger church for the growing congregation. The project is going well, but some of the locals are not happy with the expansion and try to stop them. Coyote arrives and watches as the Hailey’s lovingly and patiently deal wih setback after setback, rarely lashing out at anyone or fighting. Coyote decides to find out why and who wants the Hailey’s dead before he carries out the deed. He discovers that a wealthy businessman  is behind all the trouble. Now, Coyote has to decide whether to help the Christians or to ignore everything and complete the job.

## End

Coyote decides to help the Hailey’s after being moved by one of their church services. He goes to see the businessman. Matteo Black, and threatens to kill Black if he doesn’t leave the Christians alone. Black, furious, refuses and instead hires another hitman. Coyote and the hitman face off before Mrs. Hailey arrives and stops the two from killing each other. Showing extreme courage, the Hailey’s invite the hitmen into their temporary home and feed them. Coyote tells them everything and asks them to help him become a Christian too. The Hailey’s gladly agree and the other hitman leaves. Coyote blackmails Mr. Black and Black leaves the Hailey’s alone.
