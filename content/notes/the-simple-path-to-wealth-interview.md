When you are investing, simplicity is key. Keeping things simple helps ensure that you can stay on the path to financial freedom without spending a bunch of time, money, and resources that you don't have.

The main thing working against us is that Wall Street likes to say that everyone can become millionaires by paying _them_ a bunch of money. This is not true.

Index investing says that you buy ever stock in the index, which includes the mediocre and low-performing stocks, diversifying your stocks across many companies. This can be confusing to people because it seems too simple to be true. Logic says that buying the best stocks would bring in the most cash, so why buy the little dogs? Because today's dogs are tomorrow's kings and today's kings might be tomorrow's fallouts. Diversifying your stocks allows you to have a more stable portfolio.

Buying a house is not an investing decision, it's a lifestyle decision. Make sure you run the numbers before you commit; make sure you understand what to expect with payments.
