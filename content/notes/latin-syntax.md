> NOTA BENE: In a Latin sentence the most important word is the _first word;_ next in importance is the _last word;_ the weakest point is the middle of the sentence. Usually the _subject_ is the most important word and is placed _first;_ then the _verb_ (in the future we will call the predicate the verb.) is placed _last._ The other words of the sentence stand between these two in the order of their importance. However, word order is **just a style and not necessarily one way** or another. That is why the endings are important to identify the different parts of the sentence.

**Subject - Modifiers of the Subject - Indirect Object - Direct Object - Adverb - Verb**

The Romans loved the periodic style--the intent of putting the verb at the end is to keep the reader or hearer in suspense--but often changed the order for variety or emphasis.
