Wow, it's been a few months since I posted anything here. I have been working on the site though, but it's just been background changes like the design and stuff; so it doesn't count. I even took down all my book drafts because some of them were outdated and I didn't have the energy to update them all. But it's 2023 and I have decided that I want to finish at least _one_ book this year. So, I will be writing more and keeping this site up-to-date with all my poetry, rants, and essays! Be sure to keep an eye out for them and share with your friends. It's really encouraging for me to get any kind of feedback (yes, even criticism).
