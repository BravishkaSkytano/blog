> Let everything that has breath praise the LORD. Praise the LORD!
>
> <cite>Psalm 150:6, NKJV</cite>

The Book of Psalms is my favorite book in the Bible, it's full of encouragement and praise. When I think about all that the writers of Psalms, especially David, went through and how they *still* worshiped the Lord. The writers spoke wonderful words of praise to the Lord, and they displayed huge amounts of faith to Him. That alone is a testimony in itself. I could sing the beauty of Psalms all day, but right now, I want to focus on the very last chapter in this bookâ€•chapter 150.

Psalm 150, true to the entire purpose of the Book of Psalms, focuses primarily on praise. It commands all the musicians to praise the Lord with their instruments. David calls each instrument by name and commands it to make noise for the Great King. In the last verse, however, David changes his focus from the instruments to "everything that has breath" and commands them to praise God.

Some time ago, after studying this chapter, my youth director's wife pointed out that *all* we need, all we *ever* need to praise the Lord, is our breath. We came to this conclusion by looking at verse 6 and examining the word "breath." What we found was that just by breathing we are praising God. Just by *breathing.* You don't need a voice or limbs. You don't need hearing or sight. *All you require is your **breath**.* Do not think that the only way to praise  God is through an elegant voice or graceful dancing. I know people who don't have either, and yet they sing and dance without shame! We can praise God by just waking up and taking a deep breath. We praise Him with our very thoughts! You could be a bedridden deaf invalid and praise the Lord better than anyone else in your entire town, just by breathing. That is just amazing.

Remember this, all that you do, down to the shortest breath you take, is a type of worship to God. So, do everything with a thankful and humble heart for you are praising your Father in heaven.
