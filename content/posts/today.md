Sometimes I wonder what's different 'bout today\
It doesn't take long till I find something to say.\
Every day is different in its own way.<!-- more -->\
Every day is special and as unique as today.\
Everybody likes tomorrow and sure, it's swell,\
But today is a day to be liked as well.\
You see, today you'll grow and learn something new.\
Today you'll grow into a brand new you.\
Today you'll laugh and maybe cry,\
But today you'll learn how to fly.\
Yes, tomorrow is great,\
I won't deny that,\
But today's the day that's greater than great.\
You see, today is the day you'll learn to be great.
