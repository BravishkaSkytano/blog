The main courses in school include English, social science, science, foreign language, and humanities.  
  
In English, you will find courses about literature, grammar, writing, speaking and listening, and vocabulary.  
  
Social science includes anthropology, economics, and political science. Pretty much the study of the human world.  
  
That isn't to be confused with science, which covers subjects like life science, mathematics, and the rest of the  
natural world.  
  
Foreign language is pretty easy, popular choices are Spanish, French, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.  
  
Subjects of humanities are religion, philosophy, and history.
