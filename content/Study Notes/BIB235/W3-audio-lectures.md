- ["the great sea"](Dan%207.md#2) is either the Mediterranean Sea or figuratively the Gentile kings and/or kingdoms like in [Isaiah 57:20](Isa%2057.md#20) and [Revelation 17:15](Rev%2017.md#15)

## [Dan 7,15-28](Dan%207.md#15)[](Dan%207.md#16)[](Dan%207.md#17)[](Dan%207.md#18)[](Dan%207.md#19)[](Dan%207.md#20)[](Dan%207.md#21)[](Dan%207.md#22)[](Dan%207.md#23)[](Dan%207.md#24)[](Dan%207.md#25)[](Dan%207.md#26)[](Dan%207.md#27)[](Dan%207.md#28)  
- the Koine Greek word for "angel" literally means "mailman" or "envoy"  
- the saints will rule the earth, but they are not the ones who will establish it; the earth will be *given* to them  
- the Church isn't mentioned in the OT, this is probably referring more to the Jews. See [Revelation 20:4-6](Rev%2020.md#4) and [Matthew 19:28](Matt%2019.md#28)  
- FYI, guys in NYC still "bust a sag" and it's still ridiculous. My late grandmother used to carry belts to give to guys and then she told them about Jesus XD  
- In Rev 13:7, John only mentions the "church" in the beginning of Revelations and at the end, but not in the middle. The "saints" are used in the middle  
- A time in Hebrew means one. 3 1/2 times equals 42 months or 3 1/2 years  
- the Jews follow a Lunar calendar of 12 months and 30 days each
