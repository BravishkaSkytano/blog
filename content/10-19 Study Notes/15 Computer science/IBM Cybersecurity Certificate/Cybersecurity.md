Secrecy, or [confidentiality](confidentiality.md), means that only authorized people should be able to access or read specific computer systems and data.  
  
[Integrity](Integrity.md) means that only authorized people should be able to use or modify systems and data.  
  
Cybersecurity helps minimize crime and harm in the virtual world. It’s a set of techniques used to protect the secrecy, integrity, and availability of computer systems and data against threats.  
  
[Authentication](Authentication.md) is the process by which a computer understands who it is interacting with. There are 3 types: what you know, what you have, and what you are.  
  
Permissions, or [Access Control Lists](Access%20Control%20Lists.md) (ACLS) describe the access each user has to view or modify any file, or program, on a computer.  
  
[Malicious software](Malicious%20software.md) (malware) can make a program or computing system vulnerable to attacks that copy user data and allow hackers to disguise as the user.  
  
Some hack for amusement and curiosity, others for monetary gain ([cybercriminals](cybercriminals.md)), and others hack to provide a social or political goal ([hacktivists](hacktivists.md)).  
  
[Black Hat hackers](Black%20Hat%20hackers.md) steal, exploit, and sell computer vulnerabilities and data. [White Hat hackers](White%20Hat%20hackers.md) are hired by companies and governments to perform security evaluations, hunt for bugs, and try to close security holes.  
  
Attackers use bugs in a system to gain access to computer systems to overwrite data, steal user data, crash systems, or hijack the whole system.  
  
Unresolved bugs on enough systems opens up the possibility of “[worms](worms.md),” programs that automatically jump from computer to computer.  
  
[Cryptography](Cryptography.md) includes the most common forms of computer security. System architects employ them to make info secret and frustrate attackers.  
  
A [cipher](cipher.md) is an algorithm that converts plain text into ciphertext that can’t be read unless you have a key to undo the cipher. *Think encryption and decryption.*  
  
[Cryptographic techniques](Cryptographic%20techniques.md) rely on keys known by both sender and recipient.  
  
[Key exchange](Key%20exchange.md) uses an algorithm that lets 2 computers agree on a key without sending one, using one-way functions (math operations) that are easy to do in one direction, but hard to reverse. *Think paint mixtures.*  
  
[Symmetric keys](Symmetric%20keys.md) are the same on both sides and are used by the sender and receiver to encrypt and decrypt.  
  
[Asymmetric encryption](Asymmetric%20encryption.md) uses two different keys (1 public, 1 private). Senders use the public key, recipient uses their own private key.
