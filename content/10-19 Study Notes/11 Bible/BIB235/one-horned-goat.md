<sup><b>5</b></sup> As I was contemplating all this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between his eyes came out of the west, crossing the surface of the entire earth without touching the ground. <sup><b>6</b></sup> He came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and rushed at him with furious power. <sup><b>7</b></sup> I saw him approach the ram in a rage against him, and he struck the ram and shattered his two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against him, and the goat threw him to the ground and trampled him, and no one could deliver the ram from his power. <sup><b>8</b></sup> Thus the goat became very great, but at the height of his power, his large horn was broken off, and four prominent horns came up in its place, pointing toward the four winds of heaven.

The single horn between the goat’s eyes represents the first king of Greece, Alexander the Great. It rapidly moved from west to east, and it’s one large horn symbolized Alexander's single leadership. Furthermore, the goat wanted revenge for the Persian attack, and eventually, it took over the entire world before its horn was split into four.[^1]
