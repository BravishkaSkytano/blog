During 400 A.D., Rome had taken over what is now Europe, the border of North Africa, Turkey, and Syria. But by 500 A.D., Rome was severely weakened by several raids by barbarian tribes who took over the western half of Rome. Asia Minor and part of northern Egypt were still under Roman control, however, several barbarian tribes had taken over Europe. This was also when the Byzantine Empire began to rise to prominence.  
  
By 600 A.D., Rome had reclaimed part of North Africa and Italy, but most of Europe was still under the control of the barbarian tribes, who had now set up their own kingdoms. And 700 A.D. brought in the Muslim Omayyad Empire that spread as far as France before being stopped by the Frankish Kingdom. Now, Islam controlled the area spanning from Spain, down to Northern Africa, and back up to India. And three out of five prominent Christian cities were under Muslim control, leaving only Rome and Constantinople.

The Arabian region before Islam was surrounded by the Byzantine and Sassanian (Persian) Empires, as well as monotheistic people such as the Jews and the Christian groups of the peninsula.

Islam has many historical similarities with Christianity. They are both monotheistic religions with sacred texts and a central figure. Not only that, but both faiths, in their beginning stages, appealed to outcasts while calling followers to leave everything to become new people. And, followers of both Islam and Christianity were widely persecuted by the governments they inhabited.  
  
The Hadith are like Christianity’s Councils and Creeds, even if they’re more practical instead of theological.  
  
Both have struggled with philosophical arguments, such as humanity’s purpose and goal in life. Sects and factionalism was part of both religions. And violence is not something that can only be pinned on Islam, Christianity had its fair share of it as well.  
  
Another interesting fact is that both Islam and Christianity were accused of leaving the early egalitarianism view to one that was less inclusive and valued men over women. Furthermore, both religions set forth a status quo of political leaders and philosophies that were against advancement, such as the Pope in Rome and the Umayyad in Damascus. Even their capitals moved several times.  
  
Both Christianity and Islam also turned inward and secluded themselves from surrounding cultures and religions for a period of time. And, they both experienced decentralization when their empires turned into nation states.  
  
Regarding languages, Arabic and *Koine* Greek were considered the top languages by both religions, and word-of-mouth is how they found new disciples.

The Eastern world is more group- and family-focused, while the Western world is more self- or individual-focused. This is why Eastern cultures often bear shame as a group instead of pinning it only on the individual. This is why terms like “honor” and “shame” are very important in these cultures.[^1]

There are some things that Christians need to keep in mind when they are interacting with Muslims. The first thing is that Christians and Muslims use different religious vocabularies, which is expected with different religions. Second, Christians use legal terms, such as law and “canon”, that either don’t exist or have different meanings in Islamic culture. Third, the Islamic understanding that most Christians is often skewed, that’s why it’s so important to make sure that whatever knowledge you’ve heard from other Christians is actually true. And lastly, Muslims believe that our Bible, otherwise known as Tahruf, is corrupt and altered by human hands.[^2]  
  
Some more important things to keep in mind is that the West is often seen as an oppressor that has forced its viewpoints and ideologies on the Eastern world. To Muslims, the imperialism is the reason behind Islam fanaticism and the violent factions. Even the United Nations is viewed as an enemy because they established Israel as a nation in [Palestine](Palestine.md) against the wishes of the Muslims in the area. Likewise, Muslims believe the U.S. often shows favoritism towards Israel by overlooking violence done by Israel towards Palestine. Muslims even believe that the support that Christians give Jews is misplaced because of the aspersion and hatred that Jews have towards Jesus, while Muslims themselves respect Jesus and honor him in some ways.

When witnessing to them, it’s important to note what leaving the Islamic faith means to a Muslim. First, they would be ostracized by their people and family, losing their authenticity and social life. Their entire support system, including financial and social ones, would be destroyed.
