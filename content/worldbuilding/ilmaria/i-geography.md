Dominated by towering mountains made of translucent crystals, this region glows with an otherworldly light. Home to the reclusive [Gemfolk](Gemfolk.md), these peaks are rich in magical minerals that power much of Ilmariaâ€™s arcane technology.  
  
## Eldoria Forests  
  
Vast, ancient woodlands filled with towering trees, bioluminescent flora, and mystical creatures. This region is the heartland of the [Elves](Elves.md), who live in harmony with nature and guard the ancient secrets of the forest.

## Sunken Abyss  
  
An underwater realm with sprawling coral cities and bioluminescent fauna. The cities of the [Merfolk](Merfolk.md) are marvels of bioluminescent architecture. They have an intimate knowledge of the ocean's depths and possess powerful water magic.
