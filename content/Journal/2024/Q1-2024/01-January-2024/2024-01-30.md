Woke up, did my devotion. It was on [Mark 13 > 33](Mark%2013.md#33) on how we need to take care of the possessions God has given us until Jesus returns.

I just got back from Dunkin, their Wake Up Pancake is so small lol. Anyway, I walked there and it took me about 12 minutes there and another 12 back. The walk back felt quicker though for some reason. Now, I'm ready to play RuneScape :D

Bruh, I can't play RuneScape through Steam on Linux???? Okay.... RuneScape has an official Linux installer though so I guess I just have to install it that way.

Instead of playing RuneScape, I watched The Vampire Diaries. This whole Katherine thing is getting annoying.
