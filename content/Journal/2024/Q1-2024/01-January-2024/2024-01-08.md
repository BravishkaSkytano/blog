### Journal  
  
- We attended [The Virtues Campus](The%20Virtues%20Campus.md) online today, and I had a lot of trouble paying attention because I was so tired.  
- We want to the Morgan's place  
	- [Mama Marcia](Mama%20Marcia.md) tore her Achille's heel  
	- [Papa Lenny](Papa%20Lenny.md) was so fascinated with the Amazon Echo Show. He couldn't believe it could do so much and was trying to figure out how. It was so fun watching him stare at the thing.
