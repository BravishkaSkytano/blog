#### New Tasks  
  
### Journal  
  
#### 08:22  
  
We're at CCOB for Sidewalk Advocacy Training, and this is going to take a while.  
  
#### 16:29  
  
The training was okay, but it took so long. We're on our way back to NY and I really need to finish these school assignments.  
  
Also, I need to be more consistant in my journal entries because there are some stuff I don't want to forget, like the day I got my first gaming laptop! Mom really surprised me with that, I never would've guessed that she would just buy a laptop for $350 without planning just because it was on clearance. Still wow.  
  
  
#### 19:25  
  
I want to start on BSB importation today. Hopefully, I can get somewhere while I listen to my math videos.
