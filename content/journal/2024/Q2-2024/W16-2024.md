## Memos  
  
- [Thursday](./04-April-2024/2024.04.17.md)  
	- Today at [Virtues](The%20Virtues%20Campus.md), we studied the theology of [Hebrews](55.58%20Hebrews.md)  
- [BIO102 Natural Science and Biology](BIO102%20Natural%20Science%20and%20Biology.md) - [The Biblical Basis for Modern Science - Henry Morris](The%20Biblical%20Basis%20for%20Modern%20Science%20-%20Henry%20Morris.md) - Chapter 5: Creation of the World  
	- “Cosmogony is the study of ideas about the origin of the cosmos.” Not to be confused with cosmology, the study of the cosmos in all its aspects.  
	- The Bible contains the only real creationist cosmogony, all other systems start with an existing universe.  
	- Scientists can’t act out the creation of the universe because we were not there; consequently, the only way we can know how the universe was created is through divine revelation. And, divine revelation can only be given out by a personal, omnipotent God who exists outside time and space.  
	- According to the second law of [thermodynamics](thermodynamics.md), time had to have a beginning because the universe will “die” at some point.Embed from [2024.04.17](./04-April-2024/2024.04.17.md)
