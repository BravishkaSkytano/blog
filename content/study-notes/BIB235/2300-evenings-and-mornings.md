<sup><b>13</b></sup> Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him, ‚ÄúHow long until the fulfillment of the vision of the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, and the surrender of the sanctuary and of the host to be trampled?‚Äù <sup><b>14</b></sup> He said to me, ‚ÄúIt will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be properly restored.‚Äù   
  
The meaning isn't concrete. In 171 B.C. 2,300 *half days* from the death of [Antiochus Epiphanes](Antiochus%20Epiphanes.md) would be 171 B.C. when Onias III, the legitimate Jewish high priest, was killed. The actual desecration of the temple happened in Dec. 25, 167 B.C. with a new Greek altar. 1,150 *whole days* would point from the the new Greek altar to 1m 15d before the purification of the temple. Both interpretations could fit but insufficient historical data blocks surety.
