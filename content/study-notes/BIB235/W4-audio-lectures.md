- 2 words and 2 years after Gabriel's appearance in chapter 9  
- Daniel is around 85 years old

- Creation only took 6 *days* that's why the Jews only work for 6 *days* and they took everything in the OT **literally** #apologetics  
- Daniel is fasting, probably for the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread  
- Daniel *might* be mourning because he wasn't able to attend the Passover at home with the other Jews  
- If Daniel was a fictional character created during the Maccabees then he would've returned to Israel with the exiles, not died in Babylon #apologetics  
- There is a benefit to [short-period fasting](short-period%20fasting.md), ask the Himalayans

- the angel was fighting with Persia and then Greece, who conjured the Medo-Persian Empire  
- our prayers could be hindered by battles within the spiritual realm

- the fourth king is Ahasuerus, he had 2 million footmen  
- verses 5 - 20, 150 years of hostility between the Northern Seleucid Dynasty in Syria and the Southern Ptolemy Dynasty in Egypt  
- [v6](Dan%2011.md#6): Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the Philiphater, gave his daughter Berenice to Antiochus II Theos as part of a peace treaty. Antiochus divorced his first wife Laodice, to marry Berenice. Shortly afterwards, Ptolemy II dies and Antiochus decides to divorce Berenice and re-marry Laodice. Before the divorce could be finalized, Laodice comes and kills Berenice. Antiochus II Theos re-marries Laodice and shortly after she poisons him. **Fact check this, the story is a bit different on other sources. Other sources say Berenice is killed by Laodice after Antiochus II died and she tried to get the throne for her infant son.**  
- vv. 7-9: Berenice's brother Ptolemy III avenge's her death by killing Laodice  
- vv. 21 - 35 brings us to [Antiochus Epiphanes](202402141606.md), the demon possessed ruler who persecuted the Jews
