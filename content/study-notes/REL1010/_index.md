## Description  
  
This course provides an introduction to the theological, historical, and literary features of the Old Testament, tracing God’s covenant relationship with ancient Israel. It is an unforgettable, in-depth journey through all 39 books of the Old Testament. It follows the flow of biblical history from creation to the Transjordan, from the Conquest to the Babylonian Exile, and the Pre-exilic and Exilic Prophets. Special attention is given to how God has always related to his people through covenant–and how grace has been the cornerstone of God’s dealings with humanity since the very beginning. Students gain eye-opening insights into the culture, traditions, and prevailing religious views which enable them to fully grasp the enormity and profundity of Jesus the Messiah’s mind and message.
