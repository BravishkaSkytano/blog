[Cybersecurity](../../cybersecurity.md) is the practice of protecting and recovering data, networks, devices, and programs from malicious cyberattacks.  
  
Anything that can lead to harmful events for your network, system, or data is called a [threat](threat.md). While a [vulnerability](vulnerability.md) is a weakness in hardware, firmware, or software that hackers can exploit.  
  
Someone who tries to bypass system or network security to access data would be known as a [hacker](hacker.md). But an unauthorized hacker who acts with malicious purposes is a [cyberattacker](cyberattacker.md).  
  
[Malware](Malware.md) is software or firmware intended to conduct unauthorized actions that negatively affect system security. One example of this is a [trojan](trojan.md), an innocent-looking program that secretly gives an attacker access to your device.  
  
Key elements of cybersecurity:  
  
- **People** involves cybersecurity knowledge and habits of individuals, including their choices regarding network security.  
- **Processes** refer to the relevant processes that you're expected to follow wherever you use your device(s).
