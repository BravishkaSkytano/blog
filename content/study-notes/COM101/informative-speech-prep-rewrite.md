I think that all of you have come across a crocheted item at least once in your life, have you ever wondered how they were made? What about how they were designed? Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, my name is Yoela Olson, and I am a crochet designer who specializes in designing bags. Designing a crochet item and actually making it are two different things. Making follows a process of replicating something that someone else designed; but, designing requires you to start from a blank slate, or template, and add your own touches. Designing is usually more difficult than making the project itself, which is why most crocheters will spend hours searching for and collecting patterns for things they want to make instead of figuring out how to make it themselves.  
  
This brings us to what I want to give you a quick demonstration of, and that is the crochet design process and how you can try it out for yourselves. Now, since I specialize in crochet bags, I will use bags to illustrate my point, but these tips will work with any kind of crochet item that you want to make.  
  
First, we will go over the different kinds of bag bases to start with, and the reasons why you might choose one over the other. Then, we will look at the different ways you can customize those bases to fit the shape that you want. Next comes the fun part, you will start to graph out the design and embellishments that you want on the bag itself. Lastly, I will give you some tips on what kinds of stitches to use for different kinds of circumstances.  
  
By the end of this speech, I hope that you will have a good foundation for designing your own crochet projects for yourself and others to enjoy.
