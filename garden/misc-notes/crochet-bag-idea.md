- Four panels sewn together in a diagonal pattern
- Each panel is 16.5cm/6.4in wide, 39cm/15.3in long
- With an 8mm hook, this would be 12 sts and 32 rows
- The sewing up the sides leaves 6 rows on the top (32/6 = 5.3)

For the panels, I think the [textured wave pattern](https://mypicot.com/0029.html) will be good.

It needs a multiple of 16 + 5.

Another option might be the [double knot stitch](https://mypicot.com/0080.html), but that one is kinda big, and I'm not a huge fan of it yet.

Stitch count: multiples of 12 + 3.

And, of course, we can't forget the beautiful [wide cable stitch](https://mypicot.com/2082.html). I love cables and this wide one is perfect for my tastes. Because of the way it's made, this might be something I could use to join the panels together.

Foundation chain: 66.
