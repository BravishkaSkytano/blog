> From your reading, pick one of the three main topic ethical viewpoints: Unqualified Absolutism, Conflicting Absolutism, or Graded Absolutism. IMPORTANT! The topic you pick CANNOT be the one you agree with the most. It should be the SECOND ONE you agree with the most. Write about it. Summarize it. Give details of what that specific perspective brings to the table in our discussion of ethics. Provide pros and cons. IMPORTANT! Explain why you have difficulty in accepting this ethical viewpoint as your own. This is open-ended. Run with it and go with the spirit of the question. You have a good measure of flexibility.
