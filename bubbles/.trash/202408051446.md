> From your reading, pick one of the three main topic ethical viewpoints: antinomianism, situationism, and generalism. Write about it. Summarize it. Give details of what that specific perspective brings to the table in our discussion of ethics. Provide pros and cons. And, within the context of your writing, compare and contrast that viewpoint (the one you have chosen) with the other two. Does one seem more legit? In your opinion, is one more easily justifiable? This is open-ended. Run with it and go with the spirit of the question. You have a good measure of flexibility.
