## Description

This course provides an introduction to the theological, historical, and literary features of the Old Testament, tracing God’s covenant relationship with ancient Israel. It is an unforgettable, in-depth journey through all 39 books of the Old Testament. It follows the flow of biblical history from creation to the Transjordan, from the Conquest to the Babylonian Exile, and the Pre-exilic and Exilic Prophets.
